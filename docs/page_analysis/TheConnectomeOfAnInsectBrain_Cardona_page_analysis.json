      "full_text": "We characterized neuron types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, as well as \ncross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and \ninterhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending \nneurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain's most recurrent circuits comprised the \ninput and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer \nshortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The \nidentified brain architecture provides a basis for future experimental and theoretical studies of \nneural circuits.\nIntroduction\nOne of the brain's defining characteristics is its synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome. A \nsynapse-resolution connectome is therefore an essential prerequisite for understanding the \nmechanisms of brain function (1, 2). To date, complete synaptic-resolution connec-tomes \nhave only been mapped for three organisms with up to several hundred brain neurons \n(3\u20135). Reconstructing and proof-reading circuits from larger brains has been extremely \nchallenging. Synapse-resolution circuitry of larger brains has therefore been approached \nonly considering select subregions (6\u20138). However, pervasive interconnectivity has been \nobserved between brain regions (9, 10). Large-scale recording of functional activity in \ninvertebrates (11) and vertebrates (12) demonstrates that neural computations occur across \nspatially dispersed brain regions, highlighting the need for brain-wide circuit studies.\nWe therefore sought to generate a comprehensive synapse-resolution connectivity map of \na relatively complex brain of a small insect that has a rich behavioral repertoire and is \nexperimentally tractable. We settled on the 1st instar larva of Drosophila melanogaster, \nwhich has a compact brain with several thousand neurons that can be imaged at the \nnanometer scale with electron microscopy (EM) and its circuits reconstructed within a \nreasonable time frame. Its brain structures are homologous to those of adult Drosophila \nand larger insects of other species (13\u201315). The 1st instar larva already has as rich a \nrepertoire of adaptive behaviors as the 3rd instar (16\u201318), including short- and long-term \nmemory (13, 19, 20), value computation, and action selection (19, 21\u201323). Furthermore, \nthe circuit architecture is stable throughout larval stages (24). Thus, although neurons grow \nin size to accompany the growth of the body, they maintain the fraction of synapses they \nreceive from specific partners. Finally, an exceptional genetic toolkit and transparent body \nmake the Drosophila larva an excellent model for manipulating and recording activity in \nspecific neurons in freely behaving animals and relating structural motifs to their function \n(19, 21\u201323, 25\u201327). We mapped all neurons of a Drosophila larva brain and annotated \ntheir synapses using computer-assisted reconstruction with CATMAID (see Methods) in a \nnanometer-resolution EM volume of the central nervous system (CNS) (23).\nResults\nReconstruction of the Drosophila larva brain in a full-CNS electron microscopy volume\nWe previously generated a synaptic-resolution EM volume of the CNS of a 1st instar \nDrosophila larva (23, 28).

      "full_text": "neuron axons and motor neuron dendrites, enabling reconstruction of all neural pathways \nfrom sensory input to motor output. Previous studies have used this EM volume to \nreconstruct most sensory inputs to the brain (455 neurons), their downstream partners, and \nthe higher-order learning center (total 1054 brain neurons). We reconstructed the remaining \n1507 neurons in the brain. The resulting dataset contains 480 input neurons and 2536 \ndifferentiated brain neurons (3016 neurons total), and ~548,000 synaptic sites (Fig. 1, A and \nB, and fig. S1, A to D). Most neurons (>99%) were reconstructed to completion, and the \nmajority of annotated synaptic sites in the brain (75%) were linked with a neuron (Fig. 1B). \nThe remaining 25% were mostly composed of small dendritic fragments, reconstruction of \nwhich is labor-intensive. Moreover, prior studies have shown that neurons make multiple \nconnections with the same partner on different dendritic branches (24, 28), so orphaned \nsynapses may affect synaptic weights of known connections but are unlikely to add entirely \nnew strong connections or change conclusions about strongly connected pathways.\nMost neurons in Drosophila are mirrored across hemispheres, such that each neuron has \na hemilateral homolog in the opposite hemisphere (28). We identified all homologous \nhemilateral partners using automated graph matching (29\u201331) followed by manual review. \nThese pairings were robust across a variety of independent morphological and connectivity \nmetrics (fig. S1, E and F). Our data suggest that 93% of brain neurons have hemilateral \nhomologous partners in the opposite hemisphere (Fig. 1C). Kenyon cells (KC) (176 neurons) \nin the learning and memory center comprise most unpaired neurons (13).\nThese homologous partners were used to identify potential reconstruction errors and \nto target proofreading to such neurons (fig. S1D). To assess the effectiveness of this \ntargeted proofreading, we randomly selected ten brain interneurons and fully proofread \nthem according to previously described methods (23, 28). Most (74%) neuron\u2192neuron \nconnections, or edges, remained unchanged. Edges that did change after proofreading \nmostly displayed a modest increase in synaptic strength, suggesting errors of omission, \nwhich were previously described as the most common type of error (28, 32) (fig. S1, G \nand H). In the following sections, we investigate neuron and connection types, the flow of \ninformation from inputs to outputs, multisensory integration, cross-hemisphere interactions, \nfeedback from outputs to inputs, and the level of recurrence in the brain and brain-nerve \ncord interactions.\nIdentification of all brain input neurons, interneurons, and output neurons\nTo facilitate the analysis of the connectome, we identified a set of broad neuron classes \nbased on prior information. Brain neurons were divided into three general categories: input \nneurons, output neurons, and interneurons (Fig. 1, D and E). Brain input neurons (Fig. 1F) \ncomprise two broad classes: (i) sensory neurons (SNs) with axons in the brain (33\u201335), and \n(ii) ascending neurons (ANs; fig. S2) that transmit somatosensory signals from the ventral \nnerve cord (VNC) (23, 36\u201338). Brain output neurons comprise three broad classes: those \nwith axons terminating in the ring gland (RGNs), descending to the SEZ (DNsSEZ), or \ndescending into the VNC (DNsVNC) (Fig. 1H). The full set of RGNs have been previously \ndescribed (35, 36, 39), whereas DNsSEZ and DNsVNC were reconstructed and identified here \nbased on axon projections (fig. S3).\nWinding et al.\nPage 3\nScience. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 16.\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n",

      "full_text": "Brain interneurons comprised all neurons with cell bodies and axons and dendrites in the \nbrain. We subdivided interneurons into classes based on previously known functional role or \ndirect connectivity with neurons of known functional role (Fig. 1G and fig. S4). We started \nwith sensory input neurons and identified their projection neurons (PNs) in the primary \nsensory neuropils and the neurons postsynaptic of these PNs in the brain center for encoding \ninnate valences (the lateral horn, LH). We used the previously characterized neurons of \nthe learning center [the mushroom body (MB)], including: the KCs that sparsely represent \nstimulus identities; MB output neurons (MBONs) that represent learned valences of stimuli; \nMB modulatory input neurons (MBINs, mostly dopaminergic, DANs) that provide teaching \nsignals for learning; and their input neurons (MB feedforward neurons, MB-FFN) (19); \nMB feedback neurons (MB-FBNs that connect MBONs and MBINs) (19); and convergence \nneurons (CN) that integrate learned and innate valences from the MB and LH (21). We also \nidentified all presynaptic partners of the three output neuron types.\nIdentification of all axons and dendrites in the brain\nTo better understand neuron morphology, we identified all axons and dendrites. In \nDrosophila, axons and dendrites contain most of a neuron's presynaptic and postsynaptic \nsites, respectively, and are separated by a linker domain devoid of synapses. We used \nan established strategy to identify the synapse-devoid linker domains (see Methods) (28). \nAxonic and dendritic compartments were defined as distal or proximal to these linker \ndomains, respectively. These data were manually proofread, and an axon-dendrite split \npoint was placed for each neuron. We determined that 95.5% of the brain (2421 neurons) \nare polarized with an identifiable axon and dendrite, 0.5% (13 neurons) are unpolarized \nwith no definable axon, and 4.0% (102 neurons) are immature (Fig. 2A). These immature \nneurons were not the developmentally arrested, small undifferentiated (SU) neurons that \nlater differentiate into adult neurons (40) and their nuclei were not heterochromatin-rich like \nthose of SU neurons, despite their general lack of arborization or synaptic sites. It is likely \nthat these immature neurons started to differentiate but were still in the process of neurite \noutgrowth and polarization when the sample was collected. This population includes 78 \nimmature KCs (13) but also 24 non-KC immature neurons, revealing limited neurogenesis of \nlarval neurons outside the memory and learning center.\nAll polarized neurons segregated pre- and post-synaptic sites within axons and dendrites, \nrespectively (Fig. 2B). However, we also found that axons often contained postsynaptic sites \nand dendrites contained presynaptic sites. Thus, neurons can synapse directly onto axons \nand dendrites can directly synapse onto other neurons.\nFour connection types: axo-dendritic, axo-axonic, dendro-axonic and dendro-dendritic\nWhereas axo-dendritic connections are well established in the literature, other nonca-nonical \ninteractions such as axo-axonic connectivity (13, 41\u201344) and dendritic output (13, 45\u201347) \nhave been observed but are not as well studied, and their prevalence was unknown. We \ntherefore identified all axodendritic (a-d), axo-axonic (a-a), dendro-dendritic (d-d), and \ndendro-axonic (d-a) connections in the brain. Most synapses were a-d (66.6%) or a-a \n(25.8%); however, there were still many d-d (5.8%) and d-a synaptic sites (1.8%, Fig. 2C).\nWinding et al.\nPage 4\nScience.

      "full_text": "Most (71.8%) of brain neurons received some level of reproducible axonic modulation (fig. \nS5). Notably, 95 neurons (3.8%) received especially large amounts of axonic input relative \nto output (fig. S5, A and B), including subsets of KCs, DANs, and predescending neurons \n(pre-DNsVNC). Neurons that make dendritic output onto other neurons were much rarer \n(16.5%), but some made an especially large amount of dendritic output relative to input, \nincluding subsets of KCs and predescending neurons (fig. S5, C and D).\nThe connectome can be thought of as four graphs (Fig. 2D), where all four graphs share \nthe same set of nodes (i.e., neurons), and the four edge types (a-d, a-a, d-d, and d-a) \neach comprise a separate graph. We quantified the number of neurons (nodes), the density, \nand maximum node degree for each graph (Fig. 2E). The axo-dendritic graph had the \nhighest density (i.e., the most connections) and highest number of neurons participating \nin connectivity, whereas the axo-axonic graph had the highest maximum degree (i.e., the \nmaximum number of synaptic partners observed in an individual neuron).\nWe next wondered whether neurons were connected by one or multiple edge types. Most \nneuron partners (95%) were connected in only one way (a-d, a-a, d-d, or d-a). However, \nwe also observed many edges with multiple connection types (fig. S6D), which occurred \nmore often than expected by a null model. The most common examples were a-d combined \nwith a-a, however many combinations were observed, including rare combinations of three-\nor four-edge types between the same neurons. Four-edge connections were mostly found \nin local neurons (LNs, i.e., neurons involved in local processing in a specific neuropil) \nand predescending neurons, whereas three-edge connections were more dispersed amongst \nmultiple cell types, but with a focus in LNs and predescending neurons (fig. S6E).\nNumerically strong connections are reproducible across brain hemispheres\nWe investigated the distribution of edge strengths for each connection type (fig. S6, A and \nB). Most edges were weak (1 or 2 synapses) for all connection types (a-d: 60%, a-a: 75%, \nd-d: 79%, d-a: 91%; 66% across all types). However, strong edges (\u22655 synapse) contained \nthe majority (a-d: 61%; across all types: 55%; fig. S6B), whereas weak edges (1 or 2 \nsynapses) contained the minority (a-d: 22%; across all types: 28%) of synaptic sites.\nWe next investigated edge symmetry across the two brain hemispheres. Edge strength \ncorrelated with interhemispheric symmetry (fig. S6C): weak edges were mostly \nasymmetrical whereas strong edges were highly conserved between hemispheres. With edge \nstrengths of at least 5 and 10 synapses, most edges (>80 and >95%, respectively) were \nsymmetrical across all edge types. Similarly, weak, variable connections were observed in C. \nelegans (48). Given that many weak connections are not reproducible between hemispheres, \nwe cannot discern whether the observed sto-chasticity is due to reconstruction error or \ndevelopmental noise (28). We therefore focus much of our analysis on strong reproducible \nconnections (see Methods). However, weak connections could have notable roles, such \nas maintaining a certain membrane potential (49), adding noise (50) or contributing to \nidiosyncratic variability in behavior.\nWinding et al.\nPage 5\nScience.

We applied the signal flow algorithm (see Methods) to the \ngraph with all edge types combined to sort neurons according to the flow from sensory \nto descending neurons. We used this input-to-output sorting to categorize connections in \nthe brain: we defined connections as feedforward if they projected from neurons closer to \nsensory periphery to neurons closer to descending neurons, and vice versa for feedback \nedges. The a-d graph displayed the most feedforward synapses; a-a and d-d graphs displayed \na mixture of feedforward and feedback, with a bias toward feedforward synapses; whereas \nthe d-a graph displayed the most feedback synapses (Fig. 2F and fig. S6, F and G).\nWe next compared neuron sortings when performed on each of the four graphs \nindependently (Fig. 2G and fig. S7). The sorting of the a-d graph best matched the summed \ngraph (graph with all edge types combined) and sorted the network from sensory periphery \nto brain output neurons. The a-a and a-d graphs displayed a similar flow from sensory to \noutput, despite the details of the sorting being different (Spearman's correlation coefficient \n= 0.44 between the signal flow sorting of the a-a and a-d graphs). Notably, the d-a graph \nsorting tended to be the inverse of the a-d graph's (Spearman's correlation coefficient = \n\u20130.61), i.e., starting at brain output neurons and ending at the sensory periphery. Most d-a \nedges (63%) were the inverse of a-d edges (i.e., there was a high edge reciprocity; Fig. 2H), \nwhich explains the inverse relationship between these graphs.\nA-a and to a lesser extent d-d connections displayed high edge reciprocity, meaning many \nneurons displayed reciprocal a-a connections and d-d connections, respectively (Fig. 2H). \nNote that because all connections are directional, such reciprocal loops were not guaranteed \nto occur.\nHierarchical clustering estimates 93 connectivity-based brain neuron types\nNext, we subdivided brain neurons into types based on their synaptic connectivity. We used \nthe graph structure of all four connection types to spectrally embed all brain neurons in a \nshared space and clustered them using this representation (see Methods). This resulted in \nnested sets of clusters that can be examined at a desired granularity, from large groups of \nneurons to 93 fine-grained cell types (Fig. 3A and fig. S8, A to D). In contrast with results \nfrom community detection algorithms, our clusters are not necessarily composed of groups \nof neurons which communicate more densely within a cluster (see Methods). Instead, our \nclustering grouped neurons with similar connectivity to other neurons even if little direct \nintracluster connectivity was present\u2014for example, olfactory PNs from the antennal lobe \nwhich function as parallel input channels and whose activity is regulated as a group (33). \nThus, our approach is better suited to finding neuron types, rather than densely connected \nprocessing modules. Our connectivity-based clusters were internally consistent for attributes \nbesides connectivity. The morphology of neurons within clusters was similar, with the mean \nwithin-cluster NBLAST score (0.80 \u00b1 0.15 SD) much higher than expected by chance (0.5), \neven though clustering was based solely on connectivity and no morphological data were \nused (Fig. 3B and fig. S8, A and B). Furthermore, neurons with similar known functions \nWinding et al.\nPage 6\nScience.

S8, D to G).\nThe connectivity within and between all clusters is displayed in Fig. 3C. Many (but \nnot all) clusters displayed strong intracluster connectivity and shared output to similar \npostsynaptic clusters. A coarser granularity can also be selected (Fig. 3D) and used to \nexplore connectivity between larger groups of related neuron types.\nMost brain hubs are pre- or postsynaptic to the learning center\nHubs play key roles in brain computations and behavior (51). We therefore identified \nbrain hubs for all connection types. To focus on the strongest hubs, reproducible across \nhemispheres, we filtered the connectome to include only strong connections observed in \nboth hemispheres (using a \u22651% input threshold; see Methods). Brain hubs were defined \nas having \u226520 pre- or postsynaptic partners, respectively, i.e., an in- or out-degree of \u226520 \n[this threshold is based on the a-d network mean plus 1.5 standard deviations (SD)]. We \ndistinguished between in-hubs (over the in-degree threshold), out-hubs (over the out-degree \nthreshold), and in-out hubs (over both thresholds). Using these criteria, we identified 506 \na-d, 100 a-a, 10 d-d, and 8 d-a hubs (Fig. 3E and fig. S9). a-d out-hubs were often observed \nin clusters closer to the sensory periphery, notably PNs, whereas a-d in-hubs were more \noften closer to output clusters, including pre-output and output neurons. Most (73%, 19 \nof 26 pairs) of a-d in-out hubs were postsynaptic to the learning center output neurons \n(MBONs) and/or presynaptic to its modulatory neurons that drive learning (MBONs, CNs, \nMB-FBNs, MB-FFNs, and one pre-DNVNC pair postsynaptic to MBONs; Fig. 3F). Several \nin-out hubs (23%, 12 pairs) were convergence neurons (CNs), receiving input from both the \nMB and LH, which encode learned and innate values, respectively (19, 21). One such in-out \nhub is the CN-MBON-m1, shown to functionally integrate learned and innate values and \nbidirectionally control approach and avoidance (21).\nIdentification of all brain local neurons\nBrain neurons are often divided into local neurons (LNs), involved in local processing within \na specific brain neuropil or layer, and PNs, which carry information to other brain regions. \nTo systematically identify all brain LNs, we developed two connectivity-based definitions \n(fig. S10, A and B). Type 1 LNs provide most of their output to neurons in their sensory \nlayer (defined by the number of hops from SNs of a particular modality), and/or to the \nsensory layer directly upstream of them (fig. S10A). Type 2 LNs received most of their input \nand sent most of their output to any sensory layer, to which it did not belong (fig. S10B). \nIn this way, we identified all previously published LNs (13, 33, 34) and many new putative \nLNs (fig. S10, C and D). We then defined all 2nd order PNs by exclusion, i.e., all neurons \nthat were not local but were directly downstream of SNs (fig. S10E). Non-LN neurons that \nare higher order (i.e., not directly downstream of SNs) are usually termed output neurons \nfrom a specific neuropile (13, 52, 53) rather than PNs, but we refrain from labeling them \nin a specific way and leave them undefined as non-LNs. Although our LN definitions were \nconnectivity-based, they provided results that matched morphological expectations. Namely, \nthe Euclidean distance between the axon and dendrite of local neurons was small, whereas \nfor PNs the axon-dendrite distance was large (fig. S10F).

Overall, progressively fewer LNs \nwere found further from the sensory periphery.\nIdentification of all brain sensory pathways\nWe systematically characterized brainwide pathways from distinct types of SNs to all \nother brain neurons. For the remainder of the paper, we will focus our analysis on a-d \nconnections because they are the most abundant and best understood in terms of functional \neffects. We generated all possible a-d pathways from brain input neurons to all other \nbrain neurons and ending at output neurons in fewer than 6 hops (Fig. 3G). We classified \ninput neurons based on their known sensory modalities. Olfactory (33), gustatory (35), \nthermosensory (54), visual (34), gut (35), and respiratory state SNs (55) project directly to \nthe brain. Somatosensory ANs from the nerve cord received direct or indirect input from \nmechanosensory (22, 23), nociceptive (23, 56), and proprioceptive SNs (28) (fig. S2 and \ntable S1) and their axons projected to the brain.\nWe identified all 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-order brain neurons downstream of each input \nmodality (Fig. 4, A to C). For the purpose of this analysis, we defined the order of a neuron \naccording to its lowest order input from any input neuron type. However, neurons can \nreceive multipath input from the same input neuron type, through distinct paths of different \nlengths (e.g., they can be both 2nd-and 3rd-order). Many brain neurons (545; 21%) were \n2nd order, but most (1410; 56%) were 3rd order (received input from a SN in two hops). A \nconsiderable number were 4th order (377; 15%), but only 16 neurons (<1%) were 5th order \n(Fig. 4C). Note that 188 brain neurons (7%) were either immature or received only input \nfrom neurons in the SEZ of unknown modality and were therefore not categorized. Of the \nneurons analyzed, no brain neuron was more than 4 hops removed from at least one input \nneuron and most were only 2 or 3 hops removed.\nMost 2nd-order neurons received direct input from a single SN type (Fig. 4B), with some \nexceptions, including olfactory local neurons that also received input from gustatory and \nthermowarm SNs (33, 54). 3rd-order neurons were more often shared across modalities and \nby the 4th order, most neurons were shared across modalities (Fig. 4B). However, even \nneurons that are exclusively 2nd or 3rd order for one modality can receive input from other \nmodalities through longer paths.\nMost sensory modalities exhibited a large expansion of neuron numbers in the 3rd order, \ncompared with 2nd-order layers (Fig. 4A and table S2), indicating prominent divergence, \ni.e., they broadcast their signals to many different downstream partners. Generally, the \nnumber of neurons downstream of 2nd-order PNs (divergence) was higher than the number \nWinding et al.\nPage 8\nScience.

Convergence was also prominent, \nwith most 3rd-order neurons receiving input from multiple 2nd-order PNs.\nSensory information can reach output neurons within one to three hops\nWe investigated the cell type identities of neurons at different processing layers, i.e., at \ndifferent hops from SNs or ANs (2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-and 5th-order neurons) within each sensory \ncircuit (Fig. 4C). Sensory information reached all cell classes within a couple hops. A \nnotable percentage of brain output neurons were 2nd order, i.e., postsynaptic (one hop) of \nSNs or ANs (DNsVNC: 13%, DNsSEZ: 53%, RGNs: 46%), or 3rd order, i.e., two hops from \nSNs or ANs (DNsVNC: 52%, DNsSEZ: 38%, RGNs: 29%). The remaining 34% of DNsVNC, \n5% of DNsSEZ, and 21% of RGNs were 4th order (three hops from SNs/ANs, Fig. 4C). \nThus, most output neurons receive sensory information within a maximum of three hops. \nHowever, although these direct (one-hop), two-hop, or three-hop connections represent the \nshortest paths to output neurons, most output neurons also received longer multihop input \nfrom SNs.\nThe highest order neurons in the brain (5th order) were not output neurons, but contained 14 \npre-output neurons, presynaptic to DNsVNC. These neurons received input from and output \nto other pre-DNsVNC (the most numerous group of 4th-order neurons) and shared some \nupstream and downstream partners, suggesting complex, multilayered connectivity between \npre-DNsVNC (fig. S11). This suggests that, even though DNVNC neurons can receive sensory \ninput in very few hops, they also receive the most processed information in the brain through \nlonger paths. We observed multiple parallel pathways from each sensory modality to DNs \n(fig. S12, A and B). However, we also found extensive connectivity between neurons within \nthese parallel pathways, suggesting they likely form a distributed processing network (fig. \nS12C). Most pathways and most individual neurons within paths were not restricted to a \nparticular sensory modality and were instead shared by multiple modalities (fig. S12, D and \nE).\nDifferent sensory modalities targeted different types of output neurons (Fig. 4C). For \nexample, gustatory and gut sensory signals targeted more DNsSEZ than DNsVNC, whereas \nother modalities targeted more DNsVNC than DNsSEZ. Generally, sensory pathways to \nDNsSEZ were shorter compared with pathways to DNsVNC. Most DNsSEZ were 2nd order \n(receiving direct inputs from SNs) whereas most DNsVNC were 3rd order.\nOutput neurons receive input from the same modality through multiple paths of varying \nlengths\nSensory information is processed both serially and in parallel (57) but the architecture \nof sensory circuits is not fully understood. While characterizing the shortest paths from \nSNs to output neurons, we observed that output neurons also receive sensory information \nthrough longer paths. The additional hops in longer paths likely result in further processing \nof the stimulus, which may be important to extract more abstract features (58, 59) or to \nlayer more complex computations on top of existing ones (60). To provide a basis for a \ncomprehensive understanding of sensory processing circuits, we therefore systematically \nanalyzed all pathways and not just the shortest ones.\nWinding et al.\nPage 9\nScience.

Synapse counts can be used to accurately predict synaptic surface area and \nare therefore a good proxy for synaptic strength (61). This tool therefore captures all \npolysynaptic pathways with reasonably strong connections along their length. The algorithm \nmakes no assumption about the sign of connections and assumes that both excitatory and \ninhibitory connections can influence the activity of downstream neurons relative to baseline \nactivity. In support of this assumption, patch-clamp recordings show that larval neurons \nhave baseline activity that can be bidirectionally modified (19, 22) and direct optogenetic \ninhibition; further, activation of neurons relative to their own baseline can promote opposite \nactions (21).\nSignals can be started and terminated at predefined neurons to explore all pathways that link \nthem. We use brain output neurons as end points unless otherwise mentioned. In cascades \nstarted at SNs, the signal generally reached DNsVNC in 3 to 6 hops and rarely more than \n8 hops (Fig. 4E), which we therefore considered the maximum depth of the brain. 5-hop \npathways were shown to be functional in the larva (specifically, MD class IV neurons to \nMB DANs) (19), but no studies have yet functionally tested 6-, 7-, or 8-hop pathways. We \ntherefore stop the cascades at either 8 or 5 hops, using 8 hops to not miss long paths and \n5 hops to determine which aspects of architecture are apparent with a pathway length for \nwhich functional connectivity has been confirmed.\nUsing 8-hop cascades, we identified all pathways between SNs or ANs and output neurons \n(Fig. 4E). Individual sensory modalities had different median pathway depths to output \nneurons (fig. S13A). Overall, olfaction and gustation displayed the shortest pathways to \noutput neurons, whereas the ascending somatosensory modalities displayed the longest.\nOutput neurons received sensory inputs from the same modality through multiple paths \nof different lengths. For example, some paths from the same sensory modality reached \nDNsVNC in 2 hops, whereas others displayed as many as 6 hops (fig. S13A). DNsVNC, on \naverage, received input from pathways of three different lengths from individual sensory \nmodalities (Fig. 4F and fig.

Nevertheless, many modalities converged \nalready at the earliest stages of sensory processing, with only 36 or 38% (with 8- and \n5-hop cascades) of 2nd-order PNs/PNssomato being unimodal (fig.

We found that \nDANs received input from all sensory modalities, including from those that normally sense \nconditioned stimuli in learning tasks (e.g., olfactory) and from proprioceptive neurons (with \n5- or 8-hop cascades; Fig. 4I). By contrast, other MB modulatory neurons (13) were not \nas integrative: only 33% (with 5- or 8-hop cascades) of octopaminergic neurons (OANs) \nreceived input from all modalities.\nIdentification of all ipsilateral, bilateral, and contralateral neurons\nThe presence of two hemispheres is a fundamental property of the brain, but the way in \nwhich information from both hemispheres is integrated and used in neural computation is \nnot well understood. To investigate the structural basis of interhemispheric interactions, we \nidentified all neurons that engaged in interhemispheric communication through contralateral \nprojections (axonal or dendritic, Fig. 5, A and B). Most (98%) of neurons displayed \nipsilateral dendrites (fig. S14). A small population of neurons (1%) had bilateral dendrites \nwith either ipsilateral, bilateral, or contralateral axons. These neurons were only observed \nin the learning center (MBONs) and brain output network (pre-DNsVNC, DNsVNC, DNsSEZ) \n(fig. S15). Although most neurons had ipsilateral (61%) a substantial number had bilateral \n(24%) or contralateral (15%) axons (Fig. 5C). Notably, 88% of a-d in-out hubs had either \ncontra- or bilateral axons, even though these neurons account for only 39% of brain neurons.\nSome neurons with bilateral axons target distinct partners in the two hemispheres\nNeurons with bilateral axons project to both hemispheres, but do they communicate \nwith homologous postsynaptic partners in both hemispheres? We calculated the cosine \nsimilarity between postsynaptic partners of individual bilaterally projecting neurons in the \ntwo hemispheres (Fig. 5D, left). Most bilateral neurons generally connected to homologous \npartners in both hemispheres, i.e., had high partner similarity scores, but there were some \nneurons that had low scores. We binned these neurons into three categories based on their \npartner similarity scores and analyzed their partners further (Fig. 5D, right; fig. S16).\nWe found 7 pairs of bilateral neurons with completely different postsynaptic partners on \nthe ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres and 13 pairs with mostly non-overlapping ipsi- \nand contralateral partners (fig. S16). All of these neurons had unilateral dendrites. Most \nasymmetric bilateral neurons synapsed onto pre-DNs or DNs in one hemisphere but not the \nother, or onto different DNs or pre-DNs in the two hemispheres.

      "full_text": "Reciprocal contralateral loops\nTo better understand information flow between brain hemispheres, we asked how ipsilateral, \nbilateral, and contralateral neurons communicate with each other and calculated their \nconnection probability (Fig. 5E). Ipsilateral neurons synapsed approximately equally onto \nipsilateral, bilateral, and contralateral neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Bilateral \nneurons had a slight preference for bilateral and contralateral neurons. Contralateral neurons \ndisplayed a notable preference for other contralateral neurons, both in terms of input and \noutput. Individual contralateral neurons synapsed onto 3.4 other contralateral neurons on \naverage (34% of their downstream partners), whereas ipsilateral neurons synapsed onto 1.5 \ncontralateral neurons on average (15% of their downstream partners).\nBecause each contralateral neuron has a homolog in the opposite hemisphere, we wondered \nwhether homologous left-right contralateral neuron pairs tended to directly synapse onto \neach other. We found that the connection probability onto a homologous contralateral \npartner was much higher than onto a nonhomologous neuron (Fig. 5F). We identified 24 \nreciprocally connected homologous pairs (10% of contralateral neurons; fig. S17). Most \nwere either pre-DNsVNC, DNsVNC, postsynaptic of the learning center outputs (MBONs), \nand/or provided feedback onto the MB DANs (figs. S17D and S18). Many homologous pair \nloops interacted amongst themselves, forming double or super loops (fig. S18B). Double \nand super loops occurred between neuron pairs with similar morphology and/or connectivity. \nOne super loop involved four neuron pairs downstream of the in-out hub, MBON-m1, which \nintegrates input from other MBONs and from the LH (21) and computes predicted values \nof stimuli. This super loop projected onto pre-DNsVNC and indirectly sent feedback onto \nMB DANs through MB-FBNs (fig. S18C). The other super loop involved five neurons \nthat projected onto DNsVNC. Thus, the reciprocal pair loops, double loops, and super \nloops appear to be prevalent in brain areas that potentially play a role in action-selection \n(downstream of MBONs and upstream of DNsVNC) and learning (upstream of MB DANs).\nInterhemispheric integration occurs across most of the brain\nOur finding that 39% of brain neurons have contra- or bilateral axons suggests that the \ntwo hemispheres are heavily interconnected and that their information could be integrated \nat many sites. To systematically investigate where interhemispheric convergence occurs, we \ngenerated signal cascades from either left-or right-side SNs and observed the resulting signal \npropagation through both hemispheres (fig. S19, A to C). Signals crossed to the opposite \nhemisphere within 2 hops and were robustly found in both hemispheres by 3 hops (fig. \nS19A). We assessed simultaneous overlap between left- and right-side sensory signals to \nfind interhemispheric integration sites. The cell types of all integrative ipsilateral, bilateral, \nand contralateral types were identified (fig. S19B). We quantified the lateralization of each \nneuron by the ratio of left and right signals they received through signal cascades. Most \nneurons (81 or 79%, using 8- or 5-hop cascades) integrated signals from both left and right \nSNs (fig. S19C). Most lateralized neurons were PNs, KCs, and DNsSEZ (Fig. 5G). Thus, \nafter integration of contralateral- and ipsilateral information on one side of the brain, the \nintegrated information is often passed back to the other hemisphere (fig. S19, D to I).\nWinding et al.\nPage 12\nScience. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 16.\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n",

      "full_text": "Analysis of brainwide pathways reveals a nested recurrent architecture\nThe dominant synaptic network of the brain comprised a-d connections (Fig. 2C), many \nof which provide feedforward signal from sensory to output systems (Fig. 2F). However, \nrecurrence is an important feature of brain circuits (19, 65) and can improve computational \npower in artificial neural nets (66). We therefore characterized the reverse signal in the a-d \nnetwork, from output neurons back toward the sensory periphery. We generated independent \nsignal cascades starting at each level-7 brain cluster (Figs. 6A and 3A). Because these \nclusters were sorted from brain inputs to outputs, we could track the extent to which signals \npropagated up or down this brain structure to other clusters. We kept these cascades short \n(ending after 2 hops) to initially limit our analysis to the shorter paths of reverse signal \nand identify its lower bound. A cascade signal that traveled up the brain cluster structure \ntoward the sensory periphery was considered backward, whereas a signal that traveled down \nthe cluster structure toward the output neurons was considered forward. Robust forward and \nbackward signal originated from nearly all brain clusters (Fig. 6B). Deeper brain clusters \n(closer to brain outputs) received mostly forward signals, whereas shallower clusters (closer \nto sensory periphery) received a mixture of forward and backward signals. Most brain \nclusters provided forward and backward signals to multiple other clusters simultaneously; \nthis was observed even for single neurons within each cluster (Fig. 6C).\nWe wondered to what extent individual neurons provide feedback to their own upstream \npartners, thereby forming recurrent loops. We therefore used multihop signal cascades from \nindividual neurons to identify their direct and indirect downstream partners throughout \nthe brain (up to 5 hops). We then determined which of these downstream partners sent \nrecurrent signals back to the source neuron. We found that 41% of brain neurons were \nrecurrent, i.e., sent signals back to at least one of their upstream partners (Fig. 6D). \nFurthermore, downstream neurons often sent recurrent signals to upstream neurons using \npaths of multiple different lengths (Fig. 6E). On average, recurrent communication between \na single downstream neuron and its upstream partner used polysynaptic paths of multiple \ndifferent lengths (on average 1.9 \u00b1 0.9 SD).\nInput and output neurons of the learning center are among the most recurrent in the brain\nWe next analyzed which brain cell classes were the most recurrent (Fig. 6F). We define \nrecurrence for individual neurons as the fraction of their polysynaptic downstream partners \n(using cascades of up to 5 hops) that sent signal back to that source neuron (also using 5-hop \ncascades) with a-d connections. Therefore, neurons with high and low recurrence scores are \nengaged in many and few recurrent loops, respectively.\nThe fraction of recurrent partners varied widely between distinct neuron classes (Fig. 6F). \nPNs and the intrinsic neurons of the learning center (KCs) had virtually no recurrent partners \n(on average, 1.2% and 0.1%, respectively). Other neurons associated with the learning \ncenter were amongst the most recurrent in the brain: DANs (57%), the modulatory neurons \nthat drive learning; MB-FBNs (51%), presynaptic to DANs and implicated in computing \npredicted value and regulating learning (19); MBONs (45%), the outputs of the learning \ncenter and presynaptic to MB-FBNs; and CNs (42%), presynaptic to both MBONs and \nLHNs, which integrate learned and innate signals (21) (Fig. 6F).

The axons of some DNsVNC (37%) \nand most DNsSEZ (66%) synapsed onto other brain neurons before descending to the \nVNC and SEZ, thus providing putative efference copy signals (i.e., copies of motor \ncommands). Single DNs broadcasted signals to neurons that were directly or indirectly \nupstream of themselves (feedback signals) or onto parallel pathways, namely neurons \nupstream of other output neurons (parallel efference copy signals; Fig. 6H).

Of those DNs that synapsed onto brain neurons, we found \nthat individual DNsVNC synapsed on average onto 6 postsynaptic neurons and indirectly \n(through 2 hops) onto 43 neurons.

The most prominent DNSEZ targets were PNs [including direct connections \nto an olfactory uniglomerular PN (uPN 67b), 5 pairs of multi-glomerular PNs, 24 pairs \nof gustatory PNs] and pre-DNVNC neurons. The most prominent DNsVNC targets were \npre-DNVNC neurons and MB-related neurons thought to play a role in memory-based action \nselection (CNs) (21) and in driving learning: MBINs (mostly dopaminergic, DANs) and \nFBNs that integrate MBON input and feed it back onto the MBINs (19) (Fig. 6H).

We reconstructed axons of brain DNs \nthat send feedforward signals outside of the brain.

We quantified the number of hops upstream \nof MNs (for motor layering, Fig. 7E) or downstream of SNs (for sensory layering) each \nA1 interneuron (Fig. 7F).

Many (71%) of \nthese pre- and pre-premotor DNVNC targets also received direct or indirect A1 sensory \ninput, sometimes from multiple modalities. We also asked whether DNVNC targeted A1 hub \nneurons (with \u226510 up-or downstream partners based on A1 network mean + 1.5 SD). Indeed, \nDNVNC targeted two hubs, namely neurons A03o (in-hub) and A18b (out-hub).\nSome descending neurons modulate sensory processing in the nerve cord\nThe depth of sensory circuits was varied from 3 hops (proprioceptive) to 7 or 8 hops \n(nociceptive and chordotonals) from SNs within A1 (Fig. 7F). DNsVNC mostly targeted \n3rd or 4th-order SNs (2 or 3 hops downstream of SNs), many of which were also \npre- or prepremotor neurons (31 and 39%, respectively). A notable exception were the \nproprioceptive circuits. DNsVNC synapsed onto several 2nd-order proprioceptive neurons \n(Fig. 7F), half of which were also pre- or prepremotor neurons.\nWe categorized DNsVNC into three types based on their direct targets (fig. S23, A to C). \nGroup 1 (20 neurons, 47.6%) targeted both premotor and 2nd-order SNs. Group 2 (10 DNs, \n23.8%) targeted 8 A1 motor circuit neurons (4 pairs) that were not part of sensory circuits \nand had axonal outputs mostly restricted to T3-A1 (fig. S23D). Group 3 (12 DNs, 28.6%) \ntargeted 12 2nd- or 3rd-order A1 SNs (6 pairs) that were not part of A1 motor circuits, \nincluding ANs (2 pairs) and long-range A1 neurons that output collectively to all thoracic \nsegments and most abdominal segments (fig.

These results suggest that DNVNC \nmodulation of post-sensory cells is propagated across the CNS, including back to the brain \nthrough ANs, within A1 itself, and across nearly all VNC segments (T1 to T3, A2 to A7).\nDirect descending-ascending connectivity reveals novel brain-nerve cord zigzag motifs\nTo better understand reciprocal brain-nerve cord communication, we analyzed neurons \nupstream and downstream of A1 ANs. We observed many instances of direct DNVNC\u2192AN \nand AN\u2192DNVNC and AN\u2192DNSEZ connectivity (but no AN\u2192RGN; Fig. 7G and fig. \nS24A). Specifically, 12 DNsVNC-A1 (30%) synapsed onto 4 ANs in A1 (11%), whereas \n24 ANs in A1 (57%) synapsed onto 22 DNsVNC (12%) and 12 DNsSEZ (7%) in the brain. \nTo test whether AN-DN and DN-AN connections were a general feature present in other \nsegments, we assayed connectivity between DNsVNC and all currently reconstructed ANs \nfrom all VNC segments. Individual DNsVNC received 3.6% (\u00b1 5.2% SD) of their input from \nANs, with some receiving >20% of their input from ANs (to a maximum of 37%). It should \nbe noted that this is an underestimate because most ANs from segments other than A1 have \nnot yet been reconstructed. Conversely, individual ANs across the VNC received 3.1% (\u00b1 \n6.1% SD) input from DNsVNC, with some receiving >20% of their input from descending \nneurons (to a maximum of 32%).\nReciprocal loops between DNsVNC and ANs were never observed.

Each neuron was split into \ntwo compartments, axon and dendrite, resulting in a rich multiplexed network with four \nconnection types, facilitating analysis. To characterize long-range brainwide anatomical \npathways, we developed an algorithm that utilizes synapse numbers between neurons to \ntrack signal propagation across polysynaptic pathways.\nConnectivity-based clustering reveals 93 distinct types of brain neurons\nNeuron types have been classified based on their functional role (19, 21, 76), morphology \n(32, 77), gene expression (78), or combinations of features (79, 80). Although these \nfeatures are likely correlated, it is still unclear which is ideal for defining neuron types \nand how neuron types based on different features correspond to each other. We performed \nan unbiased hierarchical clustering of all neurons using synaptic connectivity alone and \nidentified 93 types. The morphology of neurons within clusters was notably similar. \nFurthermore, neurons that had similar known functions were usually found in the same \nor related clusters. Thus, clustering neurons based on synaptic connectivity resulted in \nclusters that were internally consistent for other features, when those features were known. \nHowever, many clusters contained uncharacterized neurons with unknown gene expression \nand function.\nNoncanonical connection types are pronounced in learning and action-selection circuits\nAlthough most connections in the brain were a-d (66.4%), we found a significant number of \na-a (26.4%), d-d (5.4%), and d-a (1.8%) connections. Most neurons that received prominent \naxonic input were in the learning center: DANs that provide the teaching signals for learning \nand KCs that encode stimuli. Modulatory a-a DAN-to-KC input drives heterosynaptic \nplasticity of the KC-to-MBON synapse (81). DANs also receive excitatory a-a input \nfrom KCs, which provides positive feedback that facilitates memory formation (41). KCs \nalso receive a-a input from other KCs. In the adult Drosophila, a-a connections between \notherwise excitatory (cholinergic) KCs were found to be inhibitory due to expression of \ninhibitory mAChR-B in axon terminals (82). Lateral inhibition between KCs could improve \nstimulus discrimination and reduce memory generalization (13). A subset of pre-DNsVNC \nand a few somatosensory PNs, LHNs, and MBONs, and FBNs also had a high axonic input/\noutput ratio. If a-a connections in these neurons are inhibitory they could enhance contrast \nbetween representations of distinct stimuli and actions (57).\nWinding et al.\nPage 17\nScience.

This architecture \nsuggests that distinct features may not be processed independently but rather that each \nfeature may potentially influence the computation of many other features in a distributed \nnetwork. Such architecture has the potential to generate a diversity of neural responses with \nmixed selectivity for specific combinations of features thereby expanding the dimensionality \nof neural representations and increasing output flexibility (84).\nWe found that the shortest paths from sensory neurons to output neurons are surprisingly \nshallow. All output neurons receive input from sensory neurons within a maximum of 3 \nhops. However, most output neurons also received input from the same modality through \nmultiple longer pathways. Such an architecture, with connections that skip layers, is \ncharacteristic of prominent machine learning networks (85, 86), including deep residual \nlearning and U-Net architectures. Although predictive accuracy improves with depth, \nfeatures can become too abstract at deep layers leading to performance degradation (87). \nShortcuts between layers can solve this problem by combining lower-level features as an \nadditional teaching signal (85, 88). Shallower networks with shortcuts can therefore exceed \nthe performance of deeper networks lacking shortcuts (85). The layer skipping we observed \nmay therefore increase the brain's computational capacity, overcoming physiological \nconstraints on the number of neurons that limit network depth.\nRecurrent architecture of the brain with multiple nested loops\nRecurrence has been observed in many brain circuits and implicated in a range of \ncomputations (65, 89\u201392). However, the architecture of long-range recurrent pathways and \nthe nature of the feedback that each neuron receives is still poorly understood. We used \nsignal cascades to systematically identify all connected pairs of brain neurons (with up to 5 \nhops) that had a reciprocal connection (of up to 5 hops). We found that 41% of brain neurons \nreceived long-range recurrent input (up to 5 hops) from at least one of their downstream \npartners with recurrent pathways of varying lengths forming multiple nested loops.\nRecurrent nested structure can compensate for a lack of network depth in artificial neural \nnetworks (66) and supports arbitrary, taskdependent computation depth (93).\nLearning center dopaminergic neurons are amongst the most recurrent in the brain\nDANs were amongst the most recurrent neurons in the brain. Dopaminergic neurons, \nreferred to as DANs in insects, are central for learning, motivation, and action across \nthe animal kingdom (62) and are implicated in a range of human mental disorders (94). \nThe highly recurrent connectivity of DANs might deliver high-dimensional feedback (95), \nWinding et al.\nPage 18\nScience.

We find that DANs also receive long-range \nfeedback (up to 5 hops) from descending neurons, which likely encode motor commands. \nFurthermore, we found that DANs receive polysynaptic feedforward inputs from all sensory \nmodalities. DAN activity correlates with movement in both vertebrates and flies (99), which \ncould be explained by the observed input from DNsVNC or from proprioceptive neurons.\nMost brain hubs are directly downstream or upstream of the learning center\nHub neurons have been shown to play essential roles in behavior (51, 100). We found \nthat most (73%) of the larval brain's in-out hubs were postsynaptic to the learning center \noutput neurons (MBONs) and/or presynaptic to the learning center modulatory neurons \n(mostly DANs). Many were also postsynaptic to the LH that mediates innate behaviors, thus \nintegrating learned and innate values (21). One of these hubs, MBON-m1, has been shown \nto compute overall predicted value by comparing input from neurons encoding positive \nand negative values (21). MBON-m1 bidirectionally promotes approach or avoidance when \nits activity is increased or decreased, respectively. Several additional hubs identified here \nhave similar patterns of input to MBON-m1, suggesting that they may play similar roles in \ncomputing predicted values. These hubs provide direct feedback to the MB DANs and could \ntherefore play roles in regulating learning.\nCross-hemisphere interactions\nWe identified all contralaterally projecting neurons and their connections, providing a basis \nfor understanding how information from both hemispheres is used by the brain. Notably, \nneurons with contralateral axons were disproportionately represented amongst in-out hubs, \nsuggesting that they have important roles in behavior. Contralateral neurons tended to \nsynapse onto each other. Thus, after integration of contra- and ipsilateral information in \none hemisphere, the integrated information is often passed back to the other hemisphere. \nMultiple consecutive hemisphere crossings could potentially enable better discrimination \nbetween ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral events and better coordination between the \ntwo hemispheres. We also discovered multiple reciprocal pair loops between contralateral \nleft-right homologs. If inhibitory, pair loops could mediate interhemispheric comparisons, \nand if excitatory, they could be involved in signal perpetuation or short-term memory (96, \n97). Consistent with this idea, many pair loops occurred between neurons presynaptic to the \nMB DANs.\nBrain and nerve cord interactions\nOur study sheds light on brain-nerve cord interactions. DNs targeted only a small fraction \nof premotor elements that could play important roles in switching between locomotor \nstates. A subset of DNs targeted low-order post-sensory interneurons likely modulating \nsensory processing. DNs and ANs also synapsed onto each other, often forming zigzag \nmotifs (DN1\u2192AN\u2192DN2).

The \nresulting EM volume contains 4841 z-slices with an x,y,z resolution of 3.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 50 nm. \nThis dataset includes the complete CNS, including all neurons, synapses, and accessory \nstructures. Note that only the axons and dendrites of sensory neurons and motor neurons, \nrespectively, are present in the volume. However, the morphology and location of these \nneurons was sufficient to match them to the respective neurons in whole animal datasets \nand thereby identify the identities and modalities of sensory axons (33\u201335, 104) or the \ncorresponding muscle targets of motor neurons (71).\nWe identified the boundaries of the brain hemispheres and all brain neurons using \nstereotyped landmarks (105). Neurons and synapses were manually reconstructed by \nmultiple users using the Collaborative Annotation Tool for Massive Amounts of Imaging \nData, CATMAID (28). Many previous publications have contributed to the reconstruction \nof neurons in this CNS (13, 22, 23, 33\u201335, 71, 73, 104), so the completeness of brain \nneurons was first assessed using proofreading status and publication status. A complete \ncensus of the brain was conducted by examining each lineage entry point (105) to identify \nall brain cell bodies. Each cell body was then used as a seed point for iterative reconstruction \nby multiple users until all arbor end-points were identified. The reconstruction process \ngenerally followed previous descriptions (23, 28), however a targeted proofreading process \nwas used by comparing left-right homologous neuron pairs. Quantification of the results of \nthis methodology suggests it produced neuron reconstructions that are robust across multiple \nmetrics (fig. S1, E and F), although some errors of omission were observed.\nAxon and Dendrite Identification\nWe identified all axons and dendrites using a previously developed algorithm, synapse \nflow centrality (SFC) (28). In Drosophila, axons contain most presynaptic sites, whereas \ndendrites contain most postsynaptic sites, except for mushroom body Kenyon cells. SFC \nfinds the shortest physical paths along the neuronal arbor between each pair of presynaptic \nand postsynaptic sites in the neuron. The section of arbor that contains the highest number \nof these presynaptic-to-postsynaptic paths corresponds to a synapse-devoid region located \nbetween the axon and dendrite that we name the linker domain and which generally \ncorresponds to the axon initial segment. We used SFC to identify these linker domains in \nall brain neurons and assigned the axon-dendrite split point to the most proximal part of the \nlinker domain. All split points were generated automatically and then manually proofread. \nWinding et al.\nPage 20\nScience.

Given that many are not reproducible between the left and right hemispheres, \nwe cannot discern whether the observed sto-chasticity is due to errors in reconstruction \nor developmental noise in establishing new synapses or retracting them (28). We therefore \nfocus much of our analysis on the strong reproducible (symmetrical) connections.\nStrong reproducible (symmetrical) connections are defined as those that are observed \nbetween homologous pre- and postsynaptic partners in both brain hemispheres (e.g., if \na connection is observed between left-side pre- and postsynaptic neurons, a connection \nmust also be observed between the matching right-side pre- and postsynaptic neurons). \nAdditionally, these connections must account for on average \u22651% input onto the dendrite in \naxo-dendritic connections. Note that a connection in one brain hemisphere can be <1%, as \nlong as the connection on the opposite side is strong enough to compensate and both are \nobserved. For example, a 0.5% connection and a 2% connection result in a mean connection \nstrength of 1.25%, which passes the 1% threshold. Any analysis indicating use of a \u22651% \ninput threshold uses this left-right thresholding approach.\nHowever, it should be noted that weak connections could have notable functional roles, \nsuch as helping maintain a certain desirable membrane potential (49) or adding noise \nfor computation (50). They could also contribute to idiosyncratic differences in behavior \nbetween individuals.\nClustering\nWe developed a modified spectral clustering procedure to cluster brain neurons based on \nconnectivity. To achieve clustering in which homologous left and right neuron pairs are \nlikely to be in the same cluster (as opposed to having clusters comprised of left-only or \nright-only neurons), we developed a technique to perform a spectral embedding which \ncollapses left and right symmetry into a single embedding space. First, the network was \nsplit into four subgraphs: connections from neurons on the left side to neurons on the left \nside (LL), from right to right (RR), from left to right (LR), and from right to left (RL). \nEach subgraph had its edge weights transformed using a procedure called pass-to-ranks, a \nregularization scheme which replaces each edge weight with its normalized rank among \nall edges and is helpful for spectral embedding in the context of outliers or skewed \nedge weight distributions (106\u2013108). We then embed each subgraph into a d-dimensional \nEuclidean space (d = 24) using the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) as implemented \nin Graspologic (107, 108). Because of an orthogonal nonidentifiability associated with the \nlatent position estimates from ASE (107), we used a joint optimal transport/orthogonal \nProcrustes procedure (109) to align the latent positions of the LL and RR subgraphs, and \nseparately the LR and RL subgraphs. This procedure yields a representation for each node in \nterms of its ipsilateral (LL or RR) inputs and outputs, as well as its contralateral (LR or RL) \ninputs and outputs.

Finally, to ensure that homologous neuron pairs are clustered the same way, we \naverage the embeddings for a left and right node (note that most of these points were already \nclose in this embedded space due to the procedure described above).\nWith this representation for each neuron, we clustered using a hierarchical approach \nto Gaussian mixture models (GMM) inspired by past work on hierarchical stochastic \nblock models (110, 111). GMM on an ASE embedding was recently shown to be a \nconsistent way of estimating the membership assignments for a statistical network model \ncalled the stochastic block model, motivating this approach (107, 112). We use a Python \nimplementation of GMM with model selection (113, 114). In the hierarchical paradigm, all \nneurons currently under consideration are clustered using a 1-component and 2-component \nGMM. The fit of both models is evaluated using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) \nmetric (115), which is commonly used to select the number of clusters in a GMM (116). If \nthe 2-component model is preferred by the BIC score and the number of neurons is not too \nsmall (32 neurons is chosen as the cutoff), then the set of neurons under consideration is \nsplit according to this clustering. This procedure recursed until the depth of the \u201ccluster tree\u201d \nreached eight, yielding a multiresolution clustering of brain connectivity.\nFinding homologous neuron pairs through graph matching\nWe employed a family of techniques based on the Fast Approximate Quadratic (FAQ) graph \nmatching algorithm (30, 31) to predict bilateral neuron pairs on the basis of connectivity. \nThese algorithms seek to find a 1-to-1 alignment of one network's adjacency matrix with \nrespect to another which minimizes the norm of their difference. In this case, the two \nadjacency matrices were the induced subgraphs (all connections among a specified subset \nof nodes) of the left and right hemispheres (i.e., the ipsilateral connections) of the brain. \nWe used 406 groundtruth neuron pairs from previous publications (13, 21, 33) as seeds, \nspecifying a fixed, partial alignment between the two networks. The seeded graph matching \nalgorithm was randomly initialized 50 times (while preserving the known matching from the \nground truth pairs). Predicted pairs from each initialization of the algorithm were recorded. \nWe then ranked potential pairs according to how often they were matched to each other, \nmanually reviewing each potential pair for correctness. This process was iterated multiple \ntimes, with newly identified pairs added to the population of seed pairs, until all reasonable \npairings were exhausted.\nQuantifying similarity of connectivity for neuron pairs\nTo quantify the similarity in connectivity of neuron pairs (fig. S1E), we evaluated how likely \nour pairs were to be matched by an automated, unsupervised algorithm which aimed to find \nthe best alignment of the nodes of the left and right hemisphere networks. We performed \nmultiple graph matchings of the paired left and right hemisphere networks, and measured \nhow strongly each neuron on the left hemisphere was matched to each possible neuron \non the right hemisphere. To do so, we ran the previously developed FAQ graph-matching \nalgorithm (31), using K = 20 initializations and a maximum of 30 iterations for each \ninitialization (see original publication for algorithm details).

The element Dij\nk can be thought of as indicating the strength of the match \n(for that run, k) from the left hemisphere neuron i to the right hemisphere neuron j. Letting \nsk be the FAQ objective function value at the end of optimization for run k, and\nS =\n\u2211\nk = 1\nK\nsk\nbe the sum of these objective function values, we took the weighted average of solutions:\nD = 1\nS\n\u2211\nk = 1\nskDk\nto find a final doubly stochastic matrix for ranking, D.\nThen, we assessed how well bilateral pairs were matched by this assignment matrix D. We \nranked the elements of each row i of D (settling ties using the average) and then found the \nrank of that neuron's assigned pair. For instance, if a left neuron's true pair on the right \nhemisphere was the neuron it was matched to most strongly, then its neighbor rank was 1; \nif it was matched to its true pair less strongly than only one other right hemisphere neuron, \nthen its neighbor rank was 2, and so on. This provided a metric to evaluate our assigned \nneuron pairs, where high ranks for a neuron's pair in the other hemisphere indicated that the \nassignment agreed with an unsupervised matching of the two networks.\nNetwork ordering from inputs to outputs\nTo order the network from sensory neurons to output neurons (fig. S6, F and G), we \napplied the \u201csignal flow\u201d algorithm (117, 118). Intuitively, this algorithm seeks to find \na one-dimensional number (the \u201cscore\u201d) associated with each neuron, where high values \nindicate a neuron is close to the \u201ctop\u201d (inputs) of the network, and low values indicate a \nneuron is close to the \u201cbottom\u201d (outputs) of the network. To establish this ordering, this \nalgorithm finds the scores which minimize the sum of edge weights which connect neurons \nwith very different scores or which connect a low score neuron to a high score neuron \n(feedback). Unless otherwise stated, we used the network made up of all edge types when \ncomputing the signal flow score for each neuron. When sorting neuron groups, we sorted \nbased on the mean signal flow score within each group. In some analyses (Fig. 2G and \nfig. S7) we computed signal flow for each edge type network independently. For pairwise \ncomparisons of these network orderings, we computed the rank correlation (Spearman's \u03c1) \nbetween the signal flow rankings for each network.\nAnalyzing edges with multiple connection types Edge reciprocity\nReciprocity is a commonly used metric in network science which quantifies the probability \nthat two nodes in a directed network are connected through mutual edges in each direction \nWinding et al.\nPage 23\nScience.

Specifically, it is defined as the number of reciprocal edges divided by the total \nnumber of edges, where a reciprocal edge means that both Aij and Aji are present in \nthe adjacency matrix A. Here, we generalize this notion to multigraphs. With Asource \nrepresenting the unweighted, loopless adjacency matrix for the source network, and Atarget \ndefined likewise for the target network, we define the edge reciprocity r (Asource, Atarget) as r \nas r(Asource , Atarget ) =\n1\n\u2211i, j\nn Asource \u2211\ni, j\nn\nAij\nsourceAji\ntarget\nIn other words, averaged over the entire network, this is the conditional probability \nof observing a reciprocal edge (Aij\ntarget)  conditioned on observing the forward edge \n(Aij\nsource)P(Aji\ntarget = 1 \u2223Aij\nsource = 1).\nProbabilities of overlapping connection types\nTo examine the likelihood of edges with various multiple connection type combinations, we \ncounted the number of (i, j) pairs with each possible combination of edge type occurrences \nin the measured networks (e.g., an axo-dendritic edge with no other type present, axo-\ndendritic and axo-axonic but no other edge types) (fig. S6D). To calibrate expectations for \nthese counts, we used a simple null model of multiplex edge overlaps. This model assumed \nthat each of the four edge type graphs was generated independently, and modeled each \nnetwork as a random (Erdos-Renyi) network. To compute the parameters of this model, we \nfirst simply calculate the global connection probability pk for each network A(k) as\npk = 1\nn2 \u2211\ni, j\nn\nAij\n(k)\nWhere n is the number of nodes, and A(k) is the unweighted, directed adjacency matrix for \nnetwork type k (k = 1,2,3,4 corresponding with AD, AA, DA, DD, respectively). Under the \nassumptions above, the expected number of (i, j) pairs which have only axo-dendritic (AD) \nedges (denote this m([1, 0, 0, 0])) is m([1, 0, 0, 0]) = n2 p1 (1 \u2212 p2)(1 \u2212 p3)(1 \u2212 p4)\nMore generally, we denote x to be a 4-dimensional binary vector, which indicates the \npresence (1) or absence (0) of the AD, AA, DA, DD edge types, respectively.

Synapse counts can be used to \naccurately predict synaptic surface area and are therefore a good proxy for synaptic strength \n(61). Note that when investigating downstream partners of neuromodulatory neurons, such \nas dopaminergic neurons, we focus on their chemical synapses, which maintain a typical T-\nbar structure at the presynapse (13). At each time step, a new set of neurons becomes active, \nand previously active neurons enter a deactivated state for the remainder of the experiment. \nWe modified the original independent cascade model to include a set of \u201cstop\u201d neurons from \nwhich the cascade does not proceed further. This tool allows one to determine how much \nsignal from a given set of starting neurons could reach other sets of neurons in the brain, and \nafter how many timesteps (hops). Our approach differs from some previous models of signal \npropagation across a connectome in that we only allow activation from neurons which were \nactive at the last timestep, rather than from neurons which were activated at any previous \ntimestep (121, 122), allowing us to assess the temporal ordering of the potential flow of \ninformation through the brain.\nTo elaborate on the details of the model, the algorithm starts with a set of user-defined \nnodes which are initially in an active state at time t = 0, and all other nodes in an inactive \nstate, meaning they are susceptible to activation. We denote the set of active, inactive, and \ndeactivated nodes at timepoint t as St\nA, St\nI, St\nD, and Sf, respectively. Our modified cascades \nalgorithm also includes a set of nodes SE which are \u201cend\u201d nodes from which the cascade \nno longer continues\u2014these nodes can become active, but then do not propagate their signal \nat the next timepoint. To determine which nodes bcome active at the next timepoint t + 1, \neach synapse is assigned an equal probability p of transmission, with p = 0.05. For each \noutgoing synapse (i \u2192 j) from each active node that is not a stop node (i \u2208(St\nA \u2212SE)) to \neach previously unactivated node (j \u2208St\nI), we conduct an independent Bernoulli trial with \nprobability p to determine whether that synapse activates node j at the next timepoint. Nodes \nthat had at least one successful activation of an upstream presynapse are included in the set \nSt + 1\nA . Every node that was active at time t is moved to the set St + 1\nD , the deactivated nodes \nwhich cannot be activated again during the current cascade. This process was repeated for \nT timesteps, where T could vary depending on the particular question of interest. These \ncascades were run 1000 times for the same set of start and end nodes (St = 0\nA , SE). To \nunderstand how signals could propagate through the brain based on this model, we tracked \nthe probability that a node was active at a given time over these 1000 independently run \ncascades. Neurons were considered to receive cascade signals when visited in most cascade \niterations. In Fig. 4F, only pathways contributing substantial cascade signal per hop were \nconsidered (>0.1 multihop signal). When analyzing groups of neurons, signal cascade data \nwere aggregated by averaging these activation probabilities across neurons in a group.\nStatistical analysis\nMann Whitney U tests were used in fig.
