**Text Excerpt**: 5B), suggesting that the light information encoded by PRs is passed on with no alteration at the level of the first synapse.

**Text Excerpt**: input may be critical for the VPLN function. If cha-lOLP input precedes glu-lOLP input, the VPLN may potentially be activated only upon an increase in light intensity via Rh6-PRs (Figure 3D). This is unlike the other glutamatergic interneuron, glu-lOLP, which receives direct inputs from PRs and ther...
