**Key Concepts**: convergence, escape, response
**Text Excerpt**: Different combinations of nociceptive and mechanosensory stimu- lation induced different likelihoods of the key escape sequences: rolling followed by fast crawling versus fast crawling alone. Nociceptor activa- tion alone evoked a relatively low likelihood of rolling (Fig. 1c, d, Extended Data Fig. ...

**Neuron Types**: like, goro, silencing, abdominal, of, multisensory, basin, few, all, downstream, cord, thoracic, in
**Key Concepts**: convergence, response
**Text Excerpt**: significantly higher likelihood of rolling compared to activation of Basin-4 alone (70% versus 45%). Thus, information from distinct Basin types may converge again onto downstream neurons involved in triggering rolling. Goro neurons in motor nerve cord trigger rolling To identify potential sites of ...

**Key Concepts**: feedback, convergence, response
**Text Excerpt**: Ten distinct second-order projection neuron types downstream of Basins ascend to the brain (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Information (Supplementary Atlas section)). Some of these integrate Basin information across multiple distal segments of the body, either exclu- sively from a single Basin type (for ...

**Key Concepts**: feedback, convergence, calcium imaging, confocal, response
**Text Excerpt**: Basin–Goro pathways may therefore be jointly regulated based on integrated global multisensory information. Function of distinct pathways in triggering rolling Next we wanted to explore the functional role of the nerve cord and brain Basin–Goro pathways. Basin activation could activate Goro neurons ...

**Key Concepts**: feed-forward, feedback, convergence, divergence, locomotion, orientation, attraction, escape, response
**Text Excerpt**: that mediates the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion (rolling) in Drosophila larva (Fig. 6a, b). We find that mechanosen- sory and nociceptive sensory neurons converge on specific types of first-order multisensory interneurons that integrate their inputs. Then, interneurons that rece...
