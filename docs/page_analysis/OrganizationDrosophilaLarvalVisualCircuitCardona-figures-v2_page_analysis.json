In the brain, neurons cell bodies are in the outer layer (gray) and project neurits into the\nneuropil. We can distinguish four main classes of neurons: visual projection interneurons (VPN, blue), visual local interneurons (VLN, green), third-order\ninterneurons (gray) and aminergic modulatory neurons (brown). Octopaminergic/tyraminergic modulatory neurons cell bodies sit in the subesophageal\nzone (SEZ). (B) 3D reconstruction of all LON-associated neurons from the ssTEM dataset in both hemispheres (except Bolwig nerves): VLN in green:\nlocal optic lobe pioneer neurons (lOLPs); VPN in shades of blue: the projection OLP (pOLP), a novel neuron which is located in the posterior ventral\nlateral cortex (PVL09), the Pdf-lateral neurons (Pdf-LaNs), the 5th-LaN and the non-clock-LaNs (nc-LaNs); third-order neurons: VPLN in light brown and\nTiny VLN in gray; aminergic modulatory neurons: serotonergic neuron (SP2-1, orange) and SEZ-ventral-unpaired-medial-2 octopaminergic/tyraminergic\nneurons (sVUM2, brown). Posterior view. (C\u2013K) 3D reconstructions from ssTEM dataset, posterior view, dendrites in blue, axons in green, presynaptic\nsites in red, postsynaptic sites in cyan, other LON neurons in gray. VLP: ventral lateral protocerebrum. SLP: superior lateral protocerebrum. LIP: lateral\ninferior protocerebrum. Both lOLPs (cha-lOLP (C) and glu-lOLP (D)) have dense arborizations within the LON. (E) The pOLP cell body is situated with\nthe lOLP and projects to the VLP. (F) PVL09 cell body is situated postero-ventro-laterally to the LON and has an axon with a characteristic loop shape,\nextending first towards the ventro-medial protocerebrum, then towards the LIP before curving down back to the VLP, where it forms most of its\nsynaptic output. (G) The four Pdf-LaNs project to the SLP. (H) The 5th-LaN projects both to the SLP and the LIP region, whereas nc-LaN 1 and 2 (I and\nJ) mainly project to the LIP. (K) The third-order neuron VPLN cell body is situated anteriorly to the LON and it has an axon coming back in the LON in\ntop of its projections within both SLP and LIP regions.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387.002\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

A third layer of the LON, more proximal (LONp) is devoid of PR terminals. Other LON neurons in gray. (B) All\nLON layers, including the LONp, contain presynaptic sites from the lOLPs (skeletons in green, synapses in yellow). VPNs, Tiny VLN and Bolwig nerve in\ngray. (C) VPNs (blue) make synaptic connections in three main regions outside the LON. VPNs projections define three domains: dorsal domain (A,\nviolet) defined by projections in the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP), lateral domain (B, orange) in the lateral inferior protocerebrum (LIP), ventral\ndomain (C, red) in the ventral lateral protocerebrum (VLP). VLNs and Bolwig nerve in gray. (D) Schematic of the LON three layers: LONd innervated by\nRh6-PRs (dark green), LONi innervated by Rh5-PRs (dark blue) and LONp innervated by lOLPs (green); and of the three domains outside the LON were\ndifferent VPNs subtypes project to (violet, orange and red empty circles). lOLPs also make presynaptic connections in the LONd and LONi (thick line).\n(E) Connectivity table of the left LON with the percentage of postsynaptic sites of a neuron in a column from a neuron in a row. Neurons of same type\nare grouped, in brackets number of neurons in the group. Same colors as in Figure 1B. Only connections with at least two synapses found in both\nhemispheres were used. (F) Simplified diagram of the larval visual system. PRs inputs are cholinergic and define two pathways. Rh5-PRs target VPNs\n(blue area, LONi) while Rh6-PRs target the two main larval VLNs (green area, LONd). Between these two VLNs, one is cholinergic while the other one is\nglutamatergic and they both inputs onto VPNs. These VLNs also integrate aminergic modulatory inputs (brown area) that potentially bring information\nfrom the central brain. In the LONp, the two third-order neurons receive from the lOLPs. The third-order neuron VPLN, which is glutamatergic,\nadditionally receives from the serotonergic neuron, connects onto the VPNs and also projects towards the central brain (gray area) like other VPNs.\nBlack arrows: cholinergic connections.

They also share the same type of targets: VPNs (blue) including PVL09, all LaNs and the VPLN, that are direct targets of Rh5-PRs\n(dark blue) (except the VPLN) and are outputs of the LON towards the central brain. (B) The four Pdf-LaNs are the only VPNs that receive from both\nRh6-PRs and Rh5-PRs. The VPLN is a third-order neuron that does not receive any inputs from PRs. All other VPNs receive visual inputs uniquely from\nRh5-PRs. All inputs from PRs onto VPNs are situated on the target dendrites. (C) VPNs, except pOLP, are targets of the two lOLPs and these\nconnections are situated on the VPNs dendrites. Additionally, PVL09 receives inputs from both the VPLN and nc-LaN one while the Pdf-LaNs receive\nonly from the nc-LaN 1, and the 5th-LaN receive only from the VPLN. PVL09 and pOLP are reciprocally connected on their axons. All VPNs transfer light\ninformation to neurons deeper in the brain. The VPLN and pOLP additionally receive on their axons some inputs from other neuronal circuits. (D) Circuit\nmotif of the VPLN receiving from both lOLPs. E: Circuit motif of the nc-LaN one that is under regulations from cha-lOLP, glu-lOLP and the VPLN.\nMoreover, nc-LaN one connects back to the VPLN. Similar motifs can be described for other VPNs (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1).\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387.011\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

The\nVPLN also modulates the 5th/nc-LaNs group as well as PVL09. nc-LaN1 additionally connects onto the Pdf-LaNs, and both nc-LaNs connect onto the\nVPLN. pOLP is the only VPN that is not modulated by other visual interneurons, except for its strong reciprocal connections with PVL09 at their axonal\nlevel.

For\nthe left and right connectivity matrices, we plotted the components of the first nonzero eigenvector of the graph\nLaplacian associated with each neuron (x axis) as a function of the signal flow metric (y axis), measures that reflect\nthe topological role of neurons in the circuit (Varshney et al., 2011). We excluded the neuromodulatory neurons\nSP2-1, which are weakly connected, and the sVUM2md and sVUM2mx, which project bilaterally. Visual information\nflows from PRs at the top towards VPNs at the bottom. In this representation, bilaterally homologous neurons\nshare a similar position revealing that both sides have similar network topology (Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016).\nFigure 5 continued on next page\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

Comparison of the structural organization and putative functions of the Drosophila larval visual circuit with the Drosophila adult compound\neye and the vertebrate visual circuit. (A) Larval visual circuit as described in this paper. Two main groups of VPNs receive input from Rh5-PRs (purple):\none corresponds to the pOLP that only receives inputs from Rh5-PRs, whereas the second group (VPN) also receives inputs from cha and glu -lOLPs\n(red and blue) that are targets of Rh6-PRs (orange). The third-order neuron VPLN does not receive from either larval PRs but is downstream of the two\nlOLPs and connect onto the VPN group in top of its projection beyond the LON. We propose that cha and glu -lOLPs control light intensity increment\nand decrement (ON/OFF) detection respectively and transfer these information to the VPLN and the VPN group. Moreover, the VPLN may potentially\nkeep the ON/OFF responses brief. (B) Model of a single unit of the fly compound eye where R1-6 PRs (orange) are well known to be involved in\ncontrast and motion detection, whereas R7-8 PRs (purple) are involved in color sensing (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016, for\nreviews). In the lamina, R1-6 PRs make connections to the glutamatergic L1 neuron controlling the ON pathway (red) and to the cholinergic L2 neuron\ncontrolling the OFF pathway (blue). In the deeper medulla, L1 and L2 reach their targets (Mi1, Tm1/2), whereas R7-8 PRs connect to medullar neurons\n(Dm/Mi). (C) Model of the vertebrate visual circuit (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016), for reviews). Cones (purple), which are also the\ncolor sensors of the retina, connect to bipolar retinal cells (BPC) which constitute the ON or OFF pathways depending on the glutamate receptor they\nexpress (ON BPC and pathway in red, OFF BPC and pathway in blue). Rods (orange) also connect to BPC and control vision in dim light conditions.\nLONd, LONi and LONp: distal, intermediate and proximal larval optic neuropil.
