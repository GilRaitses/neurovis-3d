Fetter1, Javier Valdes Aleman1, Romain Franconville1,\nMarta Rivera-Alba1, Brett D. Mensh1, Kristin M. Branson1, Julie H. Simpson1, James W. Truman1, Albert Cardona11 & Marta Zlatic11\nNatural events present multiple types of sensory cues, each detected by a specialized sensory modality. Combining\ninformation from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding\nmultimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns\ncontribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy.\nHere we show that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest\nmode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous\nsystem, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory\nprocessing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel multimodal convergence architecture. Using\nbehavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest\nlocomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration\ncontribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel multimodal convergence architecture may be a\ngeneral feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input\u2013output functions and selective tuning to ecologically\nrelevant combinations of cues.\nA single natural event, such as the attack of a predator, often presents\nmultiple types of sensory cues, for example, visual, olfactory, tactile\nand noxious. These cues are detected separately by distinct sensors\nhighly specialized for a single type of cue. Different sensory channels\nthus provide independent estimates of the same event that can be\ncombined to improve sensitivity and reduce ambiguity1\u20133. Indeed,\nacross the animal kingdom, multi-cue events often elicit enhanced\nreactions compared to single-cue stimuli1\u20135.\nThe enhancement in reactions to multi-cue stimuli is a result of\nconvergence and integration of information from multiple modalit-\nies2,3,6. Because neurons can compute non-linear functions of their\ninputs, where convergence happens, and how often, determines the\nrepertoire of input\u2013output functions7. In artificial neural networks, a\nsingle layer of nonlinear units has strict restrictions in possible res-\nponses to combinations of inputs8,9. Adding a second layer that pro-\ncesses combinations of outputs from the first layer enables the\nnetwork to implement far more complex input\u2013output functions8\u201310\nand thus to discriminate far better between different combinations of\ninputs. Similarly, in the nervous system, an architecture in which\nneurons that receive different combinations of inputs from two mod-\nalities in one level converge on neurons in downstream levels could\nenable better discrimination between different kinds of multimodal\nstimuli and selective tuning to specific ecologically relevant combina-\ntions of the two cues.\nThe structural and functional architecture of multisensory conver-\ngence across multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy is an\nopen question for any large nervous system. Neurons that integrate\ninformation from multiple modalities have been most extensively\nstudied in higher-order and motor-control areas2,3,6,11\u201317. Multi\nsensory interactions havealso been described at earlier stages of sensory\nprocessing3,18\u201321. However, it is unclear whether the multisensory\nneurons observed at distinct levels are structurally or functionally con-\nnected, and whether they contribute to the same behaviour.\nThe Drosophila larva is an excellent model system to study the\nstructural and functional patterns of multimodal interactions across\nmultiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy and how these\npatterns contribute to behaviour. The relatively small size of its\n10,000-neuron nervous system makes it amenable to circuit mapping\nusing large scale electron microscopy reconstruction22,23. Powerful gen-\netic tools enable functional studies of uniquely identifiable neurons24\u201326.\nLarvae have distinct sensory modalities with which they can gauge\nthe degree of threat27\u201331 and an array of distinct escape behaviours\navailable for responding to threats, such as turning, digging, fast\ncrawling and rolling27,28,31\u201335. The most vigorous escape sequence con-\nsists of two locomotion modes: rolling followed by fast crawling28,32.\nRolling is the fastest\u2014and presumably the most energetically\ncostly27,28. A range of distinct aversive cues can evoke the fast crawling\nresponse without rolling, including mild nociceptive and strong\nmechanosensory stimulation28,35. In contrast, rolling is observed in\nextremely threatening situations, such as strong noxious stimu-\nlation27,28,32,33,36, or predator attack27,32, the latter of which provides\nmultiple cues, including nociceptive and mechanosensory27,31,32.\nHere we show that mechanosensory combined with nociceptive\ncues synergistically increase the likelihood of rolling, and use this\ntractable model system to determine the anatomical and functional\npatterns of convergence supporting the synergy.\nMultisensory cues enhance the selection of rolling\nWe developed an automated multisensory assay in which we activate\nlarval nociceptive multidendritic class IV (MD IV) neurons thermo-\ngenetically32,36 and larval mechanosensory chordotonal neurons using\nvibration28,31 (Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013d).\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n1These authors jointly supervised this work.\n1Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus, 19700 Helix Drive, Ashburn, Virginia 20147, USA.\n3 0\nA P R I L 2 0 1 5\n| V O L\n5 2 0\n| N A T U R E\n|\n6 3 3\nG2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

        "full_text": "Different combinations of nociceptive and mechanosensory stimu-\nlation induced different likelihoods of the key escape sequences: rolling\nfollowed by fast crawling versus fast crawling alone. Nociceptor activa-\ntion alone evoked a relatively low likelihood of rolling (Fig. 1c, d,\nExtended Data Fig. 1e and Supplementary Video 1) and a high like-\nlihood of fast crawling28 (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f). Vibration alone\nevoked only fast crawling28,33 (Extended Data Fig. 1e, f) and essentially\nno rolling (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Video 2).\nCombined with nociceptor activation, vibration increased the like-\nlihood of rolling; the effect is dose-dependent and super-additive\n(synergistic) (Fig. 1c, d, Extended Data Fig. 1g and Supplementary\nVideo 3). This vibration-induced facilitation of rolling was mediated\nthrough the mechanosensory chordotonal neurons (Fig. 1e).\nFirst-order multisensory interneurons trigger rolling\nWe suspected that the information from the two modalities converges\nonto central neurons involved in the selection of rolling. To identify\nsuch neurons and thus determine where in the sensory processing\nhierarchy multisensory convergence occurs, we performed a beha-\nvioural screen for neurons whose thermogenetic activation triggers\nrolling (see Methods). We identified a \u2018hit\u2019, the R72F11 Drosophila\nline, that drove GAL4 expression in neurons potentially early in the\nsensory processing hierarchy (Fig. 2a\u2013c and Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).\nActivating the neurons in R72F11 triggered rolling in a significant\nfraction of animals (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Videos 4 and 5),\nand inhibiting them (see Methods) significantly decreased rolling in\nresponse to bimodal stimulation (Fig. 2b).\nR72F11 drives expression selectively in four lineage-related, segmen-\ntally repeated projection neurons with basin-shaped arbors in the\nventral, sensory domain of the nerve cord; we therefore named them\nBasins-1\u20134 (Fig. 2c, d and Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013c). The dendrites of\nBasin-1 and Basin-3 span a ventrolateral domain of the nerve cord,\nwhere the mechanosensory chordotonal terminals are located37,38\n(Fig. 2c, d and Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). The dendrites of Basin-2\nand Basin-4 span both the ventrolateral chordotonal domain and a\nventromedial domain where the nociceptive MD IV terminals are\nlocated37\u201339(Fig. 2c,d and Extended Data Fig.2c, d). Wethereforeasked\nwhether the mechanosensory chordotonal and the nociceptive MD IV\nneurons directly converge on Basin-2 and Basin-4.\nIn an electron microscopy volume that spans 1.5 nerve cord seg-\nments, we reconstructed the chordotonal and MD IV arbors (Fig. 2e\nand Extended Data Fig. 2e, f) and all of their synaptic partners (a total\nof 301 neuronal arbors) (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 3a\u2013d and\nSupplementary Table 4a\u2013c). Amongst the reconstructed neurons we\nrecognized the left and right Basin-1, -2, -3 and -4 homologues\n(Fig. 2d, f and Extended Data Fig. 2c, d, g, h).\nBasin-1 and Basin-3 received many inputs (each .25 synapses and\n.15% of total input, on average) from chordotonal neurons, but very\nfew (no more than 1% of total input synapses) from MD IV neurons\n(Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2i, j). Basin-2 and Basin-4 received\nmany inputs from both chordotonal neurons (on average .20\nsynapses and .10% total input) and MD IV neurons (on average\n.20 synapses and .10% total input) (Fig. 2g and Extended Data\nFig. 2i, j), each on distinct dendritic branches (Fig. 2h). Of all the\n301 partners downstream of MD IV and chordotonal neurons, only\nBasin-2 and Basin-4 reproducibly received .5 synapses from both\nchordotonal and MD IV neurons (Fig. 2i), suggesting that they are\nprobably key integrators of chordotonal and MD IV inputs.\nTo investigate whether the observed anatomical inputs from the\nsensory neurons onto Basins were functional and excitatory, we\nimaged calcium transients in response to MD IV or chordotonal\nactivation (see Methods) collectively in all Basins (Extended Data\nFig. 4a\u2013d) or in individual Basin types (Fig. 3a, b), using lines that\ndrive expression selectively in Basin-1 or Basin-4 neurons (Extended\nData Fig. 4e\u2013h).\nIn Basin-1, we observed calcium transients in response to vibration,\nbut not in response to MD IV activation (Fig. 3a), consistent with the\nlarge number of synapses it receives from chordotonal neurons and\nthe relatively few from MD IV neurons (Fig. 2g and Extended Data\nFig. 2i). In Basin-4, we observed calcium transients in response to both\nvibration and MD IV activation (Fig. 3b), consistent with the large\nnumber of synapses it receives from both sensory types (Fig. 2g and\nExtended Data Fig. 2i). Basin-4 integrated the inputs from the two\nmodalities, responding significantly more to bimodal than to unim-\nodal stimulation (Fig. 3b, c and control in Extended Data Fig. 4i, j).\nNext, we asked whether the multisensory Basin-4 interneurons\ncontribute to rolling selection. Silencing Basin-4 neurons significantly\ndecreased rolling in response to bimodal stimulation, indicating these\nneurons are involved in triggering rolling (Fig. 3d). Selective activa-\ntion of the multisensory Basin-4 interneurons triggered rolling in a\ndose-dependent way, with strongest activation triggering rolling in\n45% of animals (Fig. 3e).\nWe also wondered whether a second level of multimodal integration\n(that is, integration of information from distinct Basin types, that\nreceive distinct combinations of chordotonal and MD IV inputs),\nenhances the selection of rolling.

Thus, information from distinct\nBasin types may converge again onto downstream neurons involved\nin triggering rolling.\nGoro neurons in motor nerve cord trigger rolling\nTo identify potential sites of convergence of information from the\ndifferent types of first-order Basin interneurons we looked at a \u2018hit\u2019\nfrom the thermogenetic activation screen, R69F06, a Drosophila line\nthat drove GAL4 expression in neurons that project far from the early\nsensory processing centres (Fig. 4a\u2013c). Thermogenetic activation of\nneurons in R69F06 triggered rolling in a high fraction of larvae (Fig. 4a\nand Supplementary Video 6), and inhibiting them significantly\ndecreased rolling in response to bimodal stimulation (Fig. 4b).\nR69F06 drives expression in a few neurons in the brain, in the sub-\noesophageal zone (SEZ) and in a pair of thoracic neurons whose\naxons descend through the dorsal, motor domain of the nerve cord\n(Fig. 4c\u2013e). Selectively activating the single pair of thoracic neurons\n(see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 5a\u2013d) triggered rolling in 76%\nof larvae (Fig. 4e, f). We named these command-like neurons Goro\n(a romanization of the Japanese for rolling).\nActivation of Basins evoked strong calcium transients in the Goro\nneurons, indicating that these cell types involved in the same behaviour\nare functionally connected (Fig. 4g, h and Extended Data Fig. 5e, f).\nTo identify the shortest anatomical pathways from Basins to Goro that\nmight support the observed functional connectivity and to determine\nwhether the information from distinct Basin types converges onto\nGoro, we again used electron microscopy reconstruction.\nNerve cord and brain pathways from Basins to Goro\nWe used a second electron microscopy volume (from a second larva)\nthat spans the entire larval nervous system and therefore also includes\nGoro neurons (Fig.5aand Supplementary Video 7).

We identified 31 pairs\nof reproducible downstream partners (Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary\nInformation (Supplementary Atlas section)). Amongst these we iden-\ntified second-order nerve cord interneurons that constitute the short-\nest pathways from Basins to Goro neurons (called A05q and A23g\nwhere \u2018A\u2019 stands for abdominal neuron; Fig. 5d). They receive inputs\nfrom distinct Basin types and synapse onto Goro neurons (Fig. 5d).\nThus, information from distinct Basin types, that receive distinct\ncombinations of MD IV and chordotonal inputs, converges onto\nGoro neurons\u2014providing a second level of multimodal convergence.\ng\nf\nFraction of all synaptic inputs (total inputs in parenthesis)\n21%\n19%\n19%\n19%\n10%\n15%\n10%\n14%\n20%\n13%\n21%\n10%\n1L\n1R\n2L\n2R\n4L\n4R\n3L\n3R\nMechanosensory\nCh\nNociceptive\nMD IV\n1%\n0.2%\n1%\nLight\nd\nNociceptive MD IV + mechanosensory Ch overlap\nMechanosensory Ch overlap\nV\nD\nBasin-1\nBasin-2\nBasin-3\nEM\nBasin-4\nNgn\nV\nD\na\nb\nc\nSynapse\nOutput site\nInput site\nV\nD\ne\nssTEM of\n1.5 nerve cord segments\nReconstruction of\nsensory terminals\nin one segment\nMechanosensory Ch\nNociceptive MD IV\nReconstruction of synaptic\npartners of sensory terminals\nPre\nPost\n(483 syn)\n(421 syn)\n(233 syn)\n(200 syn)\n(288 syn)\n(313 syn)\n(231 syn)\n(193 syn)\ni\nNeuropil\nboundary\nh\nSynapse from mechanosensory Ch            \nSynapse from nociceptive MD IV\n0\n20\n40\n60\n0\n20\n40\n60\nNo. of inputs from\nmechanosensory Ch terminals\nNo. of inputs from \nNociceptive MD IV terminals\n>5 synapses from \nnociceptive MD IV\n>5 synapses from mechanosensory Ch\nBasin-2 L Basin-2 R\nBasin-4 L\nBasin-4 R\nR72F11 inhibition\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nRolling (%)\n**\n**\nEffector ctrl\n R72F11 ctrl\n R72F11 inhibition\nMechanosensory Ch and nociceptive \nMD IV combined stimulation\nR72F11 activation\n Effector ctrl\n R72F11 ctrl\n R72F11 activation\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nRolling (%)\n**\n**\nNerve cord\nR72F11(basin)>GFP\nNeuropil (N-cad)\nBrain\nCross section\nP\nA\nNociceptive MD IV\nMechanosensory \nCh\nSensory\ndomain\nMotor domain\nBasins\nV\nD\nFigure 2 | Activation screen and electron microscopy reconstruction reveal\nfirst-order multisensory interneurons. a, Thermogenetic activation of\nneurons in R72F11 (exposing R72F11-GAL4.UAS-dTrpA1 larvae to 32 uC)\ntriggered rolling.

        "full_text": "Ten distinct second-order projection neuron types downstream of\nBasins ascend to the brain (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Information\n(Supplementary Atlas section)). Some of these integrate Basin\ninformation across multiple distal segments of the body, either exclu-\nsively from a single Basin type (for example, A00c-a6, Fig. 5e), or from\ndistinct Basin types (that receive distinct combinations of sensory\ninputs; for example, A00c-a4 and A00c-a5, Fig. 5e). Then, distinct\nsecond-order PNs, that receive distinct combinations of Basin inputs\n(and therefore distinct combinations of mechanosensory and noci-\nceptive inputs), re-converge again on third-order interneurons in the\nbrain (Fig. 5f). Thus, following convergence of local mechanosensory\nand nociceptive information from a single segment onto multisensory\nBasins, global mechanosensory and multisensory information from\nmultiple segments is integrated within the brain pathway.\nBy tracing upstream of Goro dendritic inputs (Fig. 5f and\nSupplementary Atlas) we identified brain neurons which send\ndescending axons that synapse onto Goro neurons. Tracing down-\nstream of a multisensory second-order ascending projection neuron\n(A00c-a4), we identified third-order projection neurons connecting\nthe ascending pathways from Basins to a descending path onto Goro\nneurons (Fig. 5f). Thus, the activity of the command-like Goro neu-\nrons may be modulated by the more local multisensory and unisen-\nsory information via the nerve cord Basin\u2013Goro pathway and by the\nglobal body-wide nociceptive and mechanosensory multisensory\ninformation via the brain Basin\u2013Goro pathways (Fig. 5d\u2013f).\nWe also identified a third-order SEZ feedback neuron that receives\nconvergent body-wide mechanosensory and multisensory informa-\ntion and descends through the nerve cord sensory domain (Fig. 5g).\nThe SEZ feedback neuron synapses onto the first-order (Basins) and\nsecond-order neurons from both the nerve cord (A05q) and brain\n(A00c) Basin\u2013Goro pathways (Fig. 5g).

Basin activation could activate Goro\nneurons in the absence of the brain, suggesting the nerve cord\nBasin\u2013Goro pathway is excitatory and sufficient for activating Goro\nneurons and triggering rolling (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Consistent\nwith this idea, Basin activation evoked calcium transients in their\nnerve-cord targets, the A05q neurons, and A05q activation evoked\ncalcium transients in Goro neurons, (Extended Data Fig. 6c\u2013g).\nFurthermore, thermogenetic activation of the neurons in a line that\ndrives expression, amongst others, in the A05q neurons triggered\nrolling (Extended Data Fig. 6c, h).\nCalcium imaging in the terminals of three Basin-target neurons\nthat ascend to the brain (A00c-a6, A00c-a5 and A00c-a4) (Fig. 5h)\nrevealed that, collectively, they respond to vibration, to MD IV activa-\ntion, and to Basin activation, suggesting that this connection is also\nexcitatory (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 6i, j).\nSilencing the A00c neurons decreased rolling in response to bimo-\ndal stimulation (Fig. 5j), and their co-activation with Basin-4 facili-\ntated rolling (Fig. 5k). Therefore, downstream from early local\nmultisensory integration by Basin-4, additional levels of integration\nof global mechanosensory and multisensory information appear to\nfurther facilitate the transition to rolling behaviour.\nDifferential effects on triggering roll and crawl\nThe rolling response triggered by multisensory cues (or by strong\nnociceptive cues alone) is followed by fast crawling28 (Extended\nData Fig. 1e, f). Similarly, optogenetic40 activation of the first-order\nmultisensory Basin-4 neurons triggered both locomotor modes; roll-\ning followed by fast crawling (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c). However,\noptogenetic activation of the Goro neurons triggered only rolling, but\nnot fast crawling, suggesting that they act as dedicated command-like\nneurons for rolling (Extended Data Fig. 7a\u2013c). This also suggests\nthat the act of rolling itself is insufficient to trigger fast crawling. In\nthe future it will be interesting to determine how all of the 31 novel\nneuron types directly downstream of the Basins identified in our\nelectron microscopy reconstruction (Supplementary Information\n(Supplementary Atlas section)) contribute to the selection of the\ntwo locomotor modes, rolling and crawling, in a defined sequence.\nDiscussion\nBy combining behavioural and physiological studies with large-scale\nelectron microscopy reconstruction we mapped a multisensory circuit\nc\nssTEM of whole\nL1 CNS\nReconstruction of identified\nroll-triggering neurons\nReconstruction of\nsynaptic partners\na\nD\nV\nb\nLight\nA\u2014P\nj\nA\nP\nBasins and Goro\nNerve cord\nBasin\u2013Goro pathway\nAscending\nBasin targets\nBrain Basin\u2013Goro\npathway \ni\n0\n100\nA00c \u2206F/F0 (%)\na1\na2\na3\na4\na5\na6\na7\na8/9\nNerve cord\nSD\nMD\nSD\nMD\nSD\nMD\nBasins\nGoro\nA23g\nA05q\nNerve cord\npartners\nAscending\npartners\nA00c\nContragoro\nBasins\n(a4)\nContraphone\nIpsiphone\nSD\nMD\nBasin-3\nBasin-1\nBasin-2&4\nGoro\nA23g\nA05q\nA00c\n(a4 and a5)\nContragoro\nIpsiphone\nContraphone\nSD\nMD\nSEZ\nDN\n3\u20135 \n5\u201310   synapses \n>10 \n(a6)\n}\nA00c inhibition\nRolling (%)\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n*\nEffector ctrl\nA00c ctrl\nA00c inhibition\n**\nd\ne\nf\nMultilevel feedback\nSEZ\nDN\ng\nk\nMechanosensory Ch \nand nociceptive MD IV \ncombined stimulation\nt2\nt1\nt3\nGoro>GFP\nNeuropil (neuroglian)\nBrain\nNerve cord\nBrain\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n30 \u00b0C 32 \u00b0C\nRolling (%)\n**\n**\nBasin-4 activation\nA00c activation\nBasin-4 + A00c \ncombined activation\nj\nRolling (%)\n1\n8\n6\n4\n2\n5 s\nOutput site\nInput site\nEM\nOutput site\nInput site\nh\nA00c\n(a6)\na4\na5\na6\nBrain\nA00c>GFP\nNeuropil (N-cad)\nBasins\nGoro\nA00c activation\nFigure 5 | Electron microscopy reconstruction\nreveals multiple levels of multimodal\nconvergence within Basins-to-Goro pathways.\na, Electron microscopy reconstruction of the\nBasin\u2013Goro anatomical pathways. ssTEM, serial\nsection transmission electron microscopy.\nb, Confocal image (green) and electron\nmicroscopy (EM) reconstruction of a single Goro\nneuron (magenta; see also Supplementary Video\n8).

We find that mechanosen-\nsory and nociceptive sensory neurons converge on specific types\nof first-order multisensory interneurons that integrate their inputs.\nThen, interneurons that receive distinct combinations of mechano-\nsensory and nociceptive inputs converge again at multiple levels\ndownstream, all the way to command-like neurons in the nerve cord.\nActivating just a single type of first-order multisensory interneuron\ntriggers rolling probabilistically. Co-activation of first-order inter-\nneurons that receive distinct combinations of mechanosensory and\nnociceptive inputs increases rolling probability. Thus, action selection\nstarts at the first-order multisensory interneurons and multiple stages\nof multimodal integration in the distributed network enhance this\nselection.\nGiven that spurious firing from distinct sensors is uncorrelated,\nwhereas event-derived signals will be temporally correlated across\nthe sensory channels, multimodal integration even at a single level\nimproves the signal-to-noise ratio1,3,41. Multilevel multimodal integ-\nration can offer additional advantages. Theoretical studies show that a\nmultilevel convergence architecture enables more complex input\u2013\noutput relationships7\u201310. Similarly, the multilevel multimodal conver-\ngence architecture described here could offer better discrimination\nbetween different kinds of multisensory events. The weights in such\nnetworks could be tuned either through experience or through evolu-\ntion to respond selectively to highly specific combinations of two cues.\nUsing a simple model, we can demonstrate (Extended Data Fig. 8a\u2013k)\nthat compared to early-convergence a multilevel architecture could\nspecifically enhance the selection of the fastest escape mode in the\nmost threatening situations, either in response to weak multimodal or\nstrong unimodal nociceptive cues.\nThe multilevel multimodal convergence architecture may be a gen-\neral feature in multisensory integration circuits, enabling complex\nresponse profiles tunable to specific ecological needs. For example,\nphysiological studies in mammals have identified multisensory neu-\nrons that integrate the same cues at several stages in the sensory\nprocessing hierarchy18,19,21,42,43, although it is unclear whether the mul-\ntisensory neurons at distinct levels are causally related to the same\nbehaviour. Due to the size of networks involved, synaptic-level reso-\nlution studies of the underlying convergence architecture across mul-\ntiple levels were unattainable.\nIn addition to the multilevel multimodal feed-forward convergence\nmotif, our electron microscopy reconstruction revealed higher-order\nand local feedback neurons (Figs 5g and 6a and Supplementary\nInformation (Supplementary Atlas section)). Recent theoretical mod-\nels of multisensory integration suggest that the output of individual\nmultisensory neurons is normalized by the activity of other multi-\nsensory neurons in that population, but the anatomical implementa-\ntion of such feedback has not been identified2,44. Some of the feedback\nneurons in the multisensory circuit described in this study may have\nroles in such normalization computations.\nAnother circuit motif revealed by our study is the divergence of\nsensory information into nerve cord and ascending brain pathways\nand subsequent re-convergence of the shorter and the longer pathway\nonto the same command-like neurons in motor nerve cord (Goro).\nThe nerve cord pathway integrates nociceptive and mechanosensory\ninformation from a local region of the body (few segments), whereas\nthe ascending brain pathway integrates the information across all\nbody segments and provides a means of modulating command-like\nneuron activity based on global body-wide nociceptive and mechano-\nsensory information. The multisensory circuit described here in a\ngenetically tractable model system provides a resource for investi-\ngating in detail how multiple brain and nerve cord pathways interact\nwith each other and contribute to the selection of different modes of\nlocomotion (rolling and crawling) in a defined sequence.\nThe electron microscopy volume spanning the entire insect nerv-\nous system acquired for this study can be used to map circuits that\nmediate many different behaviours. Combining information from a\ncomplete wiring diagram with functional studies has been very fruitful\nin the 302-neuron nervous system of C. elegans45,46. Recently, similar\napproaches have been applied to microcircuits in smaller regions of\nlarger nervous systems47\u201350. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that\nrelating local and global structure to function in a complete nervous\nsystem is now possible for the larger and more elaborate nervous\nsystem of an insect.\nOnline Content Methods, along with any additional Extended Data display items\nandSource Data, are available in the onlineversion of the paper; references unique\nto these sections appear only in the online paper.\nReceived 5 August 2014; accepted 6 February 2015.\nPublished online 20 April 2015.\n1.\nStein, E.

The complete genotypes of animals used in this study are shown\nin Supplementary Table 2.\nThe following strains from the Rubin GAL4/LexA collection were used for the\nfigures in the manuscript: R61D08-GAL4, R69F06-GAL4, R72F11-GAL4,\nR20B01-GAL4, R71A10-GAL4, R57F07-GAL4, R47D07-GAL4, R16E11-LexA,\nR61D08-LexA, R72F11-LexA and the control stock w;;attp2 with no GAL4 or\nLexA24,51. For the thermogenetic activation screen we selected 586 GAL4 lines26\nthat drove expression in relatively few neuron types (one to five) and used them to\ndrive expression of TRPA with UAS-dTRPA152,53.\nThe following effector stocks were used: pJFRC25-13xLexAop2-IVS-dTrpA1 in\nvk0525,54;\npJFRC48-13xLexAop2-IVS-mrytdTomato\nin\nattp18,\npJFRC20-\n8xLexAop2-IVS-GAL80-WPRE in attp1825,54; pJFRC29-10xUAS-IVS-myr::GFP-\np10 in attp254; pGP-JFRC7-20xUAS-IVS-GCaMP6s55 (Bloomington stock no.\n42749); pGP-JFRC7-20xUAS-IVS-GCaMP6f5 (Bloomington stock no. 52869);\n20xUAS-IVS-GCaMP3 (Bloomington stock no. 32236;56); and UAS-JFRC12-\n10xUAS-mryGFP (Bloomington stock no. 32197;51,54) were gifts from B. D.\nPfeiffer, G. Rubin, and the GECI project team (HHMI Janelia Research\nCampus). ppk1.9-GAL457 was a gift from D. Tracey (Duke University). ppk-\n1kb-hs43-lexA-GAD in attp40 was a stock that was previously described in ref.\n34. UAS-dTRPA152 was a gift from P. Garrity. UAS-EGFP-Kir2.158 was outcrossed\nto w1118 and gifted from D. Sitaraman (Yale University). LexAop2-P2X2\n59 was a\ngift from C.-H. Yang (Duke University; unpublished stock).\nFor\nselective\ntargeting\nthe\nGoro\nneurons,\nwe\nused\nLexAop-FLP;\nUAS.stop.dTrpA1::myc60 a gift from B. Dickson, crossed with w1118;16E11-\nLexA (attp40); R69F06-GAL4 (attp2), which drives expression in Goro neurons.\nThe expression was determined by anti-Myc antibody (seen on immunohisto-\nchemistry).\nTsh-LexA was a gift from J.-M. Knapp and J. Simpson (unpublished stock). In\nbrief, the tsh-LexA driver is an enhancer trap inserted into the 59 UTR of the tsh\nlocus. It was generated via a P-element swap that replaced the p{GawB} insertion\nof tsh-GAL461 with P{UpP65L} and the enhancer-trap LexA construct. Proper\ntargeting and orientation of P{UpP65L} were confirmed by splinkerette PCR and\nsequencing by J.-M. Knapp (unpublished results).\nLexAop2-mry-TDTomato-p10 (attp40), a gift from D. Mellert (HHMI Janelia\nResearch Campus; unpublished stock), is an mry::TDtomato fragment with\nAcNPV p1054. To selectively target Basin-4 neurons we generated a Split-\nGAL425,62 stock R72F11_AD inserted in attp40 (chromosome 2L) and\n57F07_DBD in attp2 (3L). AD and DBD combinations were assembled in a\nw1118 background. We identified R57F07 as a candidate line for this intersection\nbecause its activation also evoked rolling in the thermogenetic activation screen\n(Extended Data Fig. 4). Stochastic labelling of single cells in R57F07 and R72F11,\nusing a FLP-based strategy (see below) revealed they both drive expression in\nBasin-4. R57F07 also drove expression in other neurons in the tip of the nerve\ncord and brain (Extended Data Fig. 4).\nThe \u2018FLP-out\u2019 approach63 for stochastic single-cell labelling will be described in\ndetail elsewhere (Nern et al., manuscript in preparation). In brief, heat-shock\ninduced expression of FLP recombinase was used to excise FRT-flanked inter-\nruption cassettes from UAS reporter constructs carrying HA, V5, and Flag epi-\ntope tags, and stained with epitope-tag specific antibodies. This labelled a subset\nof the cells in the expression pattern with a stochastic combination of the\nthree labels.\nBehavioural apparatus. The apparatus comprises a video camera (DALSA\nFalcon 4M30 camera) for monitoring larvae, a ring light illuminator (Cree\nC503B-RCS-CW0Z0AA1 at 624 nm in the red), a computer (see ref. 28 for details;\navailable upon request are the bill of materials, schematic diagrams and PCB\nCAM files for the assembly of the apparatus) and two hardware modules for\ncontrolling vibration and temperature (Oven Industries PA, Model 0805). Both\nhardware modules were controlled through multi worm tracker (MWT) software\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt), as described in ref. 28.\nThe module for presenting vibration consists of a speaker (120 W, 12 inches in\ndiameter) and an amplifier (Pyle Pro PCA3) controlled by a signal generator\n(Tektronix AFG3021B). The speaker was used to generate vibrations between\n100 and 1000 Hz, with an electronic signal (1 V, 100 Hz) generating a sound\npressure level of 122 dB at the assay plate (measured by a Realistic 33-2050\nSound Level Meter). The frequency of vibration at the agar surface and vibration\nintensity (measured as acceleration in m s22) was measured with an ADXL345\n3-axis accelerometer assembled onto a small printed circuit board placed on the\nagar as described in ref. 28.\nFor thermal activation, we used a Peltier module controlled by a temperature\ncontroller (Oven Industries PA, Model 0805). An aluminium plate covered with a\nthin layer of 4% charcoal agar was placed on the Peltier module. The temperature\nof the agar was raised from 20 uC to 30 uC/32 uC to weakly/strongly activate the\ndTRPA1 channel. By using a temperature gun, we confirmed that the agar\nreached the Peltier tile setting temperature. The time to reach the target temper-\nature ranged from 3 to 8 s. The behaviour rigs were inside 32.00\u2019\u2019 wide 3 28.00\u2019\u2019\ndeep 3 60.00\u2019\u2019 high temperature-controlled enclosures with temperature settable\nfrom ambient to 40 uC in 0.1 uC steps (Life Science Engineering, Inc.). The\nhumidity in the room was monitored and held at 58%, with humidifiers\n(Humidifirst Mist Pac-5 Ultrasonic Humidifier).\nBehavioural experiments. Embryos were collected for 6 h at 18 uC and 65%\nhumidity. Larvae containing the UAS-dTrpA1 or LexA-dTrpA1 transgene were\nraised at 18 uC for 7 days with normal cornmeal food. Foraging third instar larvae\nwere used for all experiments. Larvae containing the UAS-CsChrimson transgene\nwere grown in the dark at 25 uC for 4 days on fly food containing trans-retinal\n(Sigma, R2500) at a concentration of 500 M.\nBefore the experiments, the larvae were separated from food by using 15%\nsucrose and washed with water. The larvae were then dried and placed in the\ncenter of the arena. The substrate for the behavioural experiments was 3% Bacto\nagar gel in a 25 3 25 cm square plastic plate for experiments involving thermal\nactivation and vibration stimuli, or a 10 3 10 cm plate for those involving thermal\nactivation alone. We tested approximately 15\u201350 larvae at once in the behavioural\nassays. The temperature of the entire rig was kept at 25 uC (for optogenetic\nactivation experiments) or 30 uC or 32 uC for thermogenetic activation experi-\nments. The agar plates were also kept at the desired temperature prior to experi-\nment. For optogenetic activation experiments we exposed dishes of larvae to red\nlight (630 nm, 2.4 mW per cm2). Optogenetic activation offers greater temporal\nprecision than thermogenetic activation so we used to study the ability of Basin,\nGoro and A00c neurons to trigger the entire behavioural sequence roll-fast crawl,\nor just a single element of the sequence (roll or crawl)\nThe MWT software64 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt) was used to record\nall behavioural responses and to control the presentation of vibration stimuli.\nFor the thermogenetic activation screen we used 586 GAL4 lines preselected for\nexpression in relatively few neuron types (one to five) to drive expression of\ndTRPA1. In each experiment, we exposed dishes of larvae to 32 uC to thermo-\ngenetically activate dTRPA1-expressing neurons. We detected 32 \u2018hits\u2019 that con-\ntained neurons whose thermogenetic activation evoked rolling in a significant\nfraction of animals. We analysed further hits that evoked rolling in the highest\nfraction of larvae and that drove expression in the least neuron types.\nBehaviour quantification. Larvae were tracked in real-time using the MWT\nsoftware. We rejected objects that were tracked for less than 5 seconds or moved\nless than one body length of the larva. For each larva MWT returns a contour,\nspine and centre of mass as a function of time. Raw videos are never stored. From\nthe MWT tracking data we computed the key parameters of larval motion, using\nspecific choreography (part of the MWT software package) variables28. From the\ntracking data, we detected and quantified crawling and rolling events and the\nspeed of peristaltic crawling strides as described in ref. 28, using the LARA\nsoftware package (http://sourceforge.net/projects/salam-hhmi). We also trained\na machine-learning classifier, using JAABA (Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior\nAnnotator65) to detect rolling events from the tracking data. The false detection\nrate of the JAABA rolling classifier was slightly smaller (2.8%, n 5 89) than that of\nthe LARA detection software (3.6%), but the results obtained with both methods\nwere very similar. The MATLAB code for the rolling classifier is available upon\nrequest. The data presented is a quantification of rolling events detected with\nJAABA. To calculate the percentage of animals that rolled in response to thermo-\ngenetic activation, vibration, or both, we selected for analysis all the animals that\nwere tracked throughout the entire 15-second sampling interval following stimu-\nlation. We then calculated the percentage of animals from this sample for which at\nleast one rolling event was detected during the 15-second interval. The instant-\naneous percentage of rolling and crawling larvae (Extended Data Fig. 7a) as a\nfunction of time was calculated by dividing the number of larvae performing\nrolling at each time point with the total number of larvae tracked at each\ntime point.\nSelective targeting of Goro neurons. We expressed FLP selectively in the Goro\nneurons using the weak 16E11 LexA lines (in 16ElexA/LexAop FLP;\nUAS.stop.UAS-dTRPA1::myc/R69F06). Selectively in Goro neurons, FLP\nstochastically excises the STOP cassette that prevents the expression of UAS-\ndTRPA1. Now the strong R69F06 promoter can drive high levels of dTRPA1\nexpression, selectively in Goro neurons. Since this method of Goro activation is\nstochastic we monitored rolling in response to 32 uC exposure in individual\nlarvae. We dissected all animals, noted whether they rolled or did not, and stained\ntheir nervous systems with anti-Myc, to identify those that had Goro expression.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB\n(MathWorks) software. The calcium responses in the paired trials shown in\nFig. 4f were compared both using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\nG2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Required sample size for power 0.8 was determined using GPower software\nfor paired t-test and for a large pre-specified effect size based on a few pilot trials.\nIndeed the effect size in the data was large (P 5 0.016 and d 5 1.05 for one-sided\npaired t-test and P 5 0.02 and r 5 0.81 using Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The\nspeed of peristaltic crawling strides was compared using Wilcoxcon rank sum test\n(and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). In all figures, * and **\nrepresent P , 0.05 and P , 0.01, respectively. Required sample size for power 0.8\nwas determined using GPower software for a medium pre-specified effect\nsize. The fractions of animals that rolled under the different experimental con-\nditions were compared using the x2 test. P values were corrected for multiple\ncomparisons using Bonferroni correction. Power analysis was performed as\ndescribed below.\nWe performed an analysis of the power of our statistical tests of behavior\ndifferences, given the sample sizes and effect sizes observed. In addition, we\ncomputed the minimum effect sizes our analyses would have been sensitive to\nwith a power 0.95, given the sample sizes. In our power analyses, we assumed that\nthe distribution of the fraction of larvae that rolled for the control populations, q0,\nwas known and equal to the fraction measured in a large number of trials.\nFor each experiment, we tested the null hypothesis that the fraction of experi-\nmental animals that rolled was less, more, or equal to the control fraction,\ndepending on the type of experiment. For example, when activating the Goro\nneurons, we tested whether we could reject the null hypothesis that the fraction of\nlarvae that rolled was less than or equal to the control fraction. In this case,\nassuming that each animal is an independent sample from the same distribution,\nthe number of larvae rolling follows a binomial distribution. Thus, if the null\nhypothesis is that the experimental larvae roll at most as much as control, the\nprobability that the null hypothesis holds can be computed from the binomial\ncumulative distribution function:\nPr\n\u0192q0 n,^qn\n\u00f0\n\u00de~1{binocdf ^qn,q0\n\u00f0\n\u00de\nWhere n is the number of experimental larvae tested, ^q is the measured fraction\nthat roll, and binocdf (k,r) is the binomial cumulative distribution function. We\nassumed we would reject the null hypothesis if this probability was less than 0.01.\nFor a given q0 and n, we can thus compute ^q\u0002\nq0,n, the minimum ^q such that we\nwould reject the null hypothesis using this equation.\nTo compute the power of this statistical test given the sample size n and true\nfraction of experimental larvae expected to roll q, we assumed that our collected\nexperimental data were independent draws from the Bernoulli distribution with\nparameter q, and computed the probability that our observed fraction of\nPr reject null hypothesisjq0\u0192q, n\n\u00f0\n\u00de~1{binocdf ^q\u0002\nq0,nn, q0\n\u0002\n\u0003\nAnalogous equations were used for testing whether the experimental rolled at\nleast as much as control or the same amount as control.\nUsing these equations, we computed the power of each statistical test given the\nobserved sample size n, control fraction that rolled q0, and the experimental\nfraction that rolled q, for each set of experiments. We also computed the min-\nimum effect size q / q0 that would be sensitive with power 0.95, given the observed\nsample size n and control fraction that rolled q0. These results are listed in\nSupplementary Tables 1 and 3.\nImmunohistochemistry. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP\n(1:1000, A11122, Invitrogen), rat anti-N-Cad (1:50, Developmental Studies\nHybridoma Bank), mouse anti-nc82 (1:20; Developmental Studies Hybridoma\nBank), mouse-anti-Myc (9E10, 1:20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank),\nrabbit anti-HA-Tag (1:300, Cell Signaling, #3724), rat anti-FLAG (1:200,\nNOVUS, NPP1-06712), mouse anti-V5 Dylight549 (1:400, AbD Serotec,\nMCA1360D549). For secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG\n(1:200, Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) and\nAlexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) were used.\nThe central nervous systems of wandering third instar larvae were dissected in\ncold Schneiders Insect medium (Sigma, S0146) and fixed in 4% phosphate-buf-\nfered saline (PBS) with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science) at\nroom temperature for 20 min. After washes in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, samples\nwere preblocked with 3% normal goat serum (NGS) in for 30 min at room\ntemperature. The samples were then incubatedin primary antibody for 2 to 3 days\nat 4 uC. After extensive washes in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS, the samples were\nincubated at 4 uC for 2 days in a secondary antibody solution. After further\nextensive washes, the samples were rinsed in PBS, dehydrated through an\nEtOH series, cleared in Xylene and mounted in DPX mountant (Sigma-\nAldrich). Images were taken with a 710 or 700 laser-scanning confocal micro-\nscope (Zeiss) under 203 0.8 NA or 633, 1.4 NA objective and processed in\nImageJ software66 (NIH).\nFunctional connectivity assay (GCaMP recording). For activation of presynap-\ntic neurons (MD IV, chordotonal, Basins or A05q) with the ATP-gated P2X2\nchannel and imaging in postsynaptic neurons (Basins, Goro, A00c or A05q), the\ncentral nervous system of wandering third instar larvae were dissected out in cold\nphysiological saline containing 103 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 26 mM\nNaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2 PO4 , 5 mM Trehalose, 6 mM sucrose, 2 mM CaCl2 2 mM\nH2O, 8 mM MgCl2 6 mM H2O, and kept stable by sticking them on poly-L-lysine\n(SIGMA, P1524) coated cover glass placed in small Sylgard (Dow Corning) plates.\nA borosilicate pipette (1 to 2 mm tip diameter) filled with 5 mM adenosine 59-\ntriphosphate (ATP, Amersham 27-1006) and 50 g ml21 Alexa Fluor 594 hydra-\nzide (Invitrogen, A10438) dye in physiological saline was positioned 3 to 5 mm\nfrom the axon terminals of the target presynaptic neurons expressing the ATP-\ngated P2X2 channel and dsRed and the ATP solution was pressure-ejected using a\nPicospritzer (Parker Hannifin Co.).\nWhen ejecting ATP onto the axon terminals of MD IV or chordotonal neurons,\nwe imaged calcium transients in the dendritic arbor of the Basin neurons, not the\ncell bodies (which in the insect are removed from the neuropil). When stimulat-\ning Basins in abdominal segments, by ejecting ATP onto their axon terminals in\nventral nerve cord, we imaged calcium transients in the dendrites of Goro (in\ndorsal thoracic nerve cord), or in axon terminals of A05q (in dorsal nerve cord)\nand A00c (in the brain). When stimulating A05q by ejecting ATP onto their\ndendrites in ventral nerve cord in abdomen, we imaged calcium transients in\nGoro dendrites in dorsal thoracic nerve cord.\nPuffs were 25 ms in duration, and the pressure was adjusted so that red fluor-\nescence (from the Alexa 594) ejection could be seen clearly while imaging.\nThe same stimulus was presented every 30 sec for a total of three trials in each\nexperiment.\nWhen vibration stimuli were also used in experiments, rather than only P2X2\nactivation, the larvae were dissected using methods similar to those described\npreviously for neuromuscular junction67 on the Sylgard plate. In brief, larvae were\ncut up along the dorsal body wall midline and then opened by placing dissection\npins. The cell bodies of abdominal peripheral sensory neurons and their nerves\nwere kept intact. The anterior tips were removed, and the CNS was attached to a\npoly-L-lysine coated cover glass. For vibration stimuli in the two-photon rig, we\nembedded piezo extension actuators (Piezo System Inc., Model Q220-A4-303XE)\nin the Sylgard plate and used TTL pulses from the Prairie View software to control\nthe timing of stimulation. The acceleration was measured with an ADXL345\n3-axis accelerometer28. The vibration stimuli were 1,000 Hz and 6.67 m s22,\n15 sec long. The same stimulus was presented every 30 sec for a total of three\ntrials in each experiment. For comparing the responses of Basin-4 to combined\nactivation (nociceptor activation with P2X2 and ATP injection plus vibration) to\nnociceptor activation or vibration alone (Figure 4d and e), each trial consisted of\nATP injection, vibration, and a combination (ATP injection and vibration), with\n30 sec between each stimulation. Three such triplet trials were presented in each\nexperiment.\nWe performed imaging on a Prairie Technologies two-photon microscope\nusing an Olympus 603 0.8 NA objective. A mode-locked Ti:Sapphire\nChameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) tuned to 925 nm was used for excitation.\nFluorescence was collected with photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu) after band-\npass filtering. Images were acquired in frame-scan mode (maximum speed,\n1,215 f.p.s.) for a single plane of the CNS.\nGCaMP image analysis. Image data were processed by ImageJ software66 (NIH)\nand analysed using custom code written in MATLAB (MathWorks). Specifically,\nregions of interest (ROIs) were determined by averaging the ten frames before\nstimulation and segmenting this data by the function MEAN68 in ImageJ. The\nmean intensity of the ROI was measured in ImageJ. In all cases, changes in\nfluorescence were calculated relative to baseline fluorescence levels (F0) as deter-\nmined by averaging over a period of at least 3 sec just before ATP puff or vibration\nstimulation. DF/F0 values were calculated as DF/F0 5 (Ft 2 F0)/F0, where Ft is the\nfluorescent mean value of a ROI in a given flame. Peak DF/F0 is the maximum\nvalue in the 5 sec window following stimulus onset.\nElectron microscopy preparation and imaging.

The isolated central\nnervous systems were immediately transferred to 125 ml of 2% glutaraldehyde in\n0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 in a 0.5 dram glass vial (Electron\nMicroscopy Sciences, cat. no. 72630-05) to which an equal volume of 2% OsO4\nin 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 was added and gently mixed. Each CNS\nwas then fixed in an ice bath in a Pelco BioWave PRO microwave oven (Ted Pella,\nInc.) at 350-W, 375-W and 400-W pulses for 30 sec each, separated by 60-sec\nintervals with the microwaves off. Samples were rinsed 3 3 30 sec at 350 W with\n0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, separated by 60-sec intervals with the micro-\nwaves off, and post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at 350-\nW, 375-W and 400-W pulses for 30 sec each, separated by 60-sec intervals with\nthe microwaves off. After rinsing with distilled water 3 3 30 sec at 350 W with 60-\nsec pauses between pulses, the samples were stained en bloc with 1% uranyl\nacetate in water by microwave at 350 W for 3 3 30 sec with 60-sec pauses between\nmicrowave pulses. The samples were then dehydrated in an ethanol series fol-\nlowed by propylene oxide, infiltrated and embedded with EPON resin. Serial 50-\nnm sections were cut with a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome using a Diatome diamond\nknife, and picked up with Synaptek slot grids with Pioloform support films with\n2 nm of carbon (C). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by\nSato\u2019s lead69.\nBoth data sets were imaged using Leginon70, the 1.5 abdominal segment on an\nFEI T20 TEM (Hillsboro) at 4.4 nm 3 4.4 nm pixel resolution, the complete L1\nbrain on an FEI Spirit TEM at 3.8 nm 3 3.8 nm pixel resolution. The resulting\nimages were montaged and registered using the nonlinear elastic method\ndescribed in ref. 23.\nNeuronal reconstruction. Reconstructions were made in a modified version of\nCATMAID71 (http://www.catmaid.org). The process of reconstructing neurons\nin CATMAID involves starting with a specified neurite in a section of the electron\nmicroscopy data, and manually building a 3D skeleton representation of the\nneuronal morphology and the location of synaptic active zones and synaptic\npartners.\nThe synaptic connections mapped and reported in this study all represent fast,\nchemical synapses. Synapses must match several criteria over multiple adjacent\nsections: a thick black active zone, vesicles, and presynaptic specializations, such\nas a T-bar, on the presynaptic side, and evidence of postsynaptic membrane\nspecializations72.\nTo identify sensory axons, reconstruction was initiated at the entry point of\nnerves into the neuropil. Sensory neurons project ventrally in the nerve cord, and\nmotor neurons project dorsally37,38,73, so the sensory axons were readily identified\nin the ventral portion of the nerve root. All sensory axons were traced and MD IV\nand chordotonal axons were recognized based on their distinguishing features,\npreviously described using confocal microscopy imaging37,38,74. Chordotonal pro-\njections were readily identified based on the characteristic intermediate location\nof their terminals in the mediolateral axis and the dorsoventral axis of the nervous\nsystem. We found that all eight chordotonal axons were already tightly bundled\ntogether in the nerve root. The MD IV projections were readily recognized based\non the characteristic medial-most and ventral-most location of their terminals.\nNeuronal partners of the eight chordotonal axons and the three MD IV axons in\nboth hemisegments were reconstructed by initiating reconstructions at the site of\nevery postsynaptic target in all chordotonal terminals until all targets were\nexhausted. A review of all skeletons was done by CMSM to identify incorrect\nor missed branches and synapses.\nIn the comprehensive L1 electron microscopy volume, Basin cells in A1 and A4\nsegments were found using landmarks such as cell body position, the entry point\nof primary neurite into the neuropil, and branch points on the primary neurite. In\nbrief, the Basin lineage was first recognized on the basis of the characteristic cell\nbody location (lateral intermediate), the trajectory of their primary neurite which\nis parallel to the entering nerve, and the neuropil entry point of the lineage, as well\nas the pattern of the low-order, large branches. The lineage contains more cells\nthan just the four Basins, but the other cells have very different projection pat-\nterns. The Basins in the A1 segment were identified by tracing the primary and\nsecondary neurites of multiple members of the lineage and abandoning those that\ndid not have the distinguishing features of the Basins. The four Basins in each\nhemisegment were reconstructed in full and individual Basins recognized based\non their unique features (see Extended Data Fig. 2). Basin targets were recon-\nstructed by tracing exhaustively downstream of all presynaptic sites in Basin\naxons. Goro neurons were found in a similar way as Basins. Starting with high-\nresolution 3D image stacks of single cells (visualized using the FLP-based strategy\ndescribed above), we looked at the cell body location, primary neurite projection,\nand major branch points. We then traced neurites consistent with the primary\nneurite projection and cell body location until finding only two individual cells,\none in each hemisegment of segment T2, with branch points consistent with Goro\nneurons. Completed reconstructions were then checked for consistency with light\ndata in axon and dendritic projections. Partial reconstructions of sibling neurons,\nas well as homologous neurons in adjacent thoracic segments, resulted in\nmorphologies very different from that of Goro neurons as observed by light\nmicroscopy, indicating that only two neurons in the whole of the thorax match\nthe expected morphological pattern. Descending neurons were found by recon-\nstruction of neurons upstream of synaptic inputs in Goro dendrites. A subset of\nfourth-order neurons was found by reconstructing downstream of all synaptic\noutput sites of only one of the ascending third-order A00c-a4 neurons. Left and\nright homologues of reconstructed neurons were identified by considering a suite\nof morphological and synaptic features, focusing on neuropil entry location,\nprimary branch locations, and the location of pre- and postsynaptic sites.\nNeuronal morphologies were analysed in MATLAB using custom scripts.\nCircuit diagrams were made in Gephi75 and edited in Adobe Illustrator CS6\n(Adobe Systems, Inc.).\nValidation of methodology of electron microscopy reconstruction. In\nDrosophila, as in other insects, the gross morphology of many neurons is stereo-\ntyped and individual neurons are uniquely identifiable based on morpho-\nlogy37,50,76,77. Furthermore, the nervous system in insects is largely bilaterally\nsymmetric and homologous neurons are reproducibly found on the left and\nthe right side of the animal. In this study we therefore validate the wiring diagram\nby: (1) independently reconstructing partners of homologous neurons on the left\nand right side of the nervous system; (2) independently reconstructing partners of\nhomologous neurons in EM volumes from two different individuals; (3) perform-\ning functional connectivity experiments to validate some key connections pre-\ndicted by the wiring diagram.\nValidating the wiring diagram by independent reconstruction on the left and\nright. By randomly re-reviewing annotated synapses and terminal arbors in our\ndataset we estimated the false positive rate of synaptic contact detection to be\n0.0167 (1 error per 60 synaptic contacts). Assuming the false positives are uncor-\nrelated, for an n-synapse connection the probability that all n are wrong (and thus\nthat the entire connection is a false positive) occurs at a rate of 0.0167n. Thus, the\nprobability that a connection is false positive reduces dramatically with the num-\nber of synaptic connections contributing to that connection.\nEven for n 5 2 synapse connections, the probability that the connection is not\ntrue is 0.00028 (once in every 3,586 two-synapse connections) and we call con-\nnections with two or more connections \u2018reliable\u2019 connections. Similarly, the\nprobability that even a one-synapse connection annotated between homologous\nneurons both on the left and on the right side of the nervous system is not true is\n0.00028. The probability that a false-positive connection with two synapses is\nobserved twice between the same cell types is even lower (0.000282). Because\nfalse-positive synapses between a single pair of homologous neurons could poten-\ntially be correlated (due to mis-annotation of a single branch with multiple con-\ntacts), we perform extra rounds of focused re-review of the arbors associated with\nconnections in our wiring diagram with less than four synapses to confirm that\nthey are neither mis-annotated synapses or incorrect branches. Furthermore,\nwhile false positives between a single pair of homologous neurons could poten-\ntially be correlated, the false positives between different pairs of homologous\nneurons (on the left side and the right side) cannot be correlated (they are not\non the same branch). Thus the probability that reliable (with two or more\nsynapses) and reproducible (found between both the left and right homologues\nwithin an individual) connections are not true is extremely low and we are highly\nconfident in such connections. All the connections discussed in this study and all\nthe principles derived from the wiring diagram are based on such reliable and\nreproducible connections.\nFalse negatives are far more common in our reconstructions than false posi-\ntives. We were able to trace 81.5% (1,676/2,054) of postsynaptic sites downstream\nof Basins back to identifiable neuronal arbors, leaving 18.5% (378/2,054) of\nsynaptic outputs associated with small, unidentifiable arbor fragments due to\nambiguities in the data. The majority have only a single synaptic input from\nBasins (163/231 fragments), and only 8/231 fragments have five or more Basin\ninputs. If the synapses that could not be associated with identified neurons were\ndistributed randomly, the likelihood of completely omitting a connection with\nn synapses is approximately 0.185n, which is 0.006 for n 5 3. Thus the like-\nlihood that we have completely omitted a three-or-more-synapse connection is\nquite low.\nReproducibility of the wiring diagram across different individuals. For a con-\nnection in the wiring diagram to be useful for future physiological and beha-\nvioural experiments in different individuals, it should not just be correctly\nidentified in one animal, but it should be generalizable across animals. We there-\nfore assessed the extent to which the connections in this wiring diagram are\nreproducible across individuals.\nFor this study we obtained electron microscopy volumes from two different\nlarvae: one comprising 1.5 nerve cord segments (a2/a3), and one comprising the\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\nG2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We reconstructed the chordotonal and MD IV sensory\nneurons, the Basin neurons and all the other partners downstream of both the\nnociceptive and the sensory neurons in both electron microscopy volumes. In the\nsmaller abd1.5 volume some of the downstream neurons had a large fraction of\ntheir arbor outside the volume and were not identifiable, whereas others were\nmostly confined within the electron microscopy volume and were uniquely iden-\ntifiable based on key morphological features. We could therefore assess the repro-\nducibility of connections between homologous neurons present and uniquely\nidentifiable in both volumes across two individuals (Extended Data Fig. 3). We\nidentified connections between neuron types that have at least two synapses and\nfor which a connection with at least two synapses also exists between homologous\nneuron types on the other side of the same individual. 100% (n 5 36) of connec-\ntions with at least two synapses per connection that were reproducible across the\nsame individual were also reproducible across individuals; that is, those connec-\ntions also existed on both sides in the other individual.\nIf we consider each individual sensory neuron in a hemisegment as unique, we\nfind a total of 76 connections (38 pairs of connections) between individual neurons\nwith at least two synapses between homologues on both the left and right of the\nsame individual. In 100% of cases in which a connection was present between\nhomologues on both sides in one animal it was also present between homologues\nin the other animal, at least on one side. 96% of connections with at least two\nsynapses that existed between homologous neurons on both sides in one animal\nalso existed between homologues on both sides in the other animal. 4% of connec-\ntions with at least two synapses present between homologues on both sides in one\nanimal were not present between homologues in the other animal on the same side,\nbut a connection was present between homologues on the other side (in the other\nhemisegment) in the other individual (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for more details).\nTogether with the above error rates, the observed reproducibility of connec-\ntions across individuals gives us strong confidence that the observation of a\nreliable connection in one animal both measures a real connection in that indi-\nvidual and predicts similar connectivity in other animals.\nFunctional validation of connections mapped using electron microscopy\nreconstruction. Another way to validate a wiring diagram is to functionally test\nthe connections obtained with electron microscopy reconstruction. If the ana-\ntomical and functional connectivity studies are done in different individuals this\nprovides further validation of the reproducibility and generalizability of the wir-\ning diagram. In this study we were able to generate reagents to functionally test a\nnumber of anatomical connections predicted by the wiring diagram. By activating\nthe presynaptic partner and monitoring calcium transients in the direct post-\nsynaptic partner we tested the following reproducible direct anatomical connec-\ntions with, on average, five or more synapses per connection:\nN MD IV onto Basin-4 (average .10 synapses per connection) (Fig. 3b)\nN Chordotonal onto Basins (average .10 synapses per connection) (Extended\nData Fig. 4d)\nN Basins onto A00c (average .10 synapses per connection) (Extended Data\nFig. 6j)\nN Basins onto A05q (average .5 synapses per connection) (Extended Data\nFig. 6e)\nN A05q onto Goro (average 5 synapses per connection) (Extended Data Fig. 6g)\nFor the anatomical connection from MD IV onto Basin-1 with only two\nsynapses per connection on average, the functional connectivity experiments\ndid not reveal a functional excitatory connection (Fig. 3a).\nModel of multilevel convergence. The model consists of two sensory inputs\nprocessed in two layers (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The sensory inputs, chordotonal\nand MD IV, have activity EMech and ENoci respectively. Sensory input intensity can\nrange from 0\u2013100 (arbitrary units), with the maximum value intended to approx-\nimate the highest intensity stimulus provided in the behavioural experiments of\nFig. 1. The first processing layer has two nodes, each representing one or more\nneurons: (1) a \u2018pure\u2019 node with output gP(EMech) that receives only mechanosen-\nsory input; and (2) a \u2018mixed\u2019 node with output gM(EMech,ENoci) that receives input\nfrom both sensory modalities. The second processing layer is a single node with\noutput gB (gP, gM) that receives input from both nodes of the first processing layer.\nThe output of the second layer constitutes the output of the circuit.\nWe considered the steady-state output of the network, assuming that the\nresponse of each node is a sigmoidal function of its total input, with a lower\nthreshold below which output is near-zero and an upper saturation point. We\nmodelled this as a logistic function78:\nf E; h,b\n\u00f0\n\u00de~Ch,b\n1\n1ze\n{ E{h\n\u00f0\n\u00de\nb\nwith total input E, threshold h, transition width b, and a constant Ch, b defined so\nthat f(100)5100. We set b510 for all nodes, which makes the transition between\nlow and high output cover about half of the input range. We omit b in subsequent\nequations for brevity.\nThe output of the pure node in the first processing layer is given by:\ngP EMech\n\u00f0\n\u00de~f EMech; hP\n\u00f0\n\u00de.\nFor the mixed node, we take the total input to be a weighted sum of the sensory\ninputs: gM EMech,ENoci\n\u00f0\n\u00de~f wMEMechz 1{wM\n\u00f0\n\u00deENoci; hM\n\u00f0\n\u00de\nwhere 0\u0192wM\u01921 measures the relative weighting of mechanosensory input. To\nrequire that the maximum total input each node can receive is the same, the\nweights sum to one.\nFor the second layer, we take total input to be a weighted sum of the outputs from\nthe nodes in the first layer:\ngB EMech,ENoci\n\u00f0\n\u00de~f wBgP EMech\n\u00f0\n\u00dez 1{wB\n\u00f0\n\u00degM EMech,ENoci\n\u00f0\n\u00de; hB\n\u00f0\n\u00de\nwhere 0\u0192wB\u01921 measures the weighting of the pure chordotonal node in the first\nlayer.\nA common feature of multisensory circuits is their enhanced sensitivity to\ncombinations of weak stimuli presented together. To consider this property in\nthe context of our circuit, we looked for circuit responses that are maximally\nsensitive to multisensory stimuli, but that are also consistent with basic experi-\nmental observations. We treated this as a constrained optimization problem; we\nfound mixing parameters wM and wB that optimize a measure of multisensory\nsensitivity, subject to the constraint that the responses to unimodal stimuli are\nsimilar to experimental observations (Extended Data Fig. 8b\u2013d). We looked at the\nresulting solutions for a range of threshold parameters.\nFor the sensitivity measure, we assumed that the optimal solutions are respons-\nive to combinations of both inputs (Extended Data Fig. 8b), as measured by the\nintegrated response along a Gaussian-weighted band centred along the\nEMech5ENoci diagonal line:\nS wM,wB\n\u00f0\n\u00de~\n\u00f0\n100\n0\n\u00f0\n100\n0\ngB EMech,ENoci\n\u00f0\n\u00dee\u0003\u0003 EMech{ENoci\n\u00f0\n\u00de=4d2dEMechdENoci\nwhere d measures the width of the band, which we set to 20 (Extended Data\nFig. 8c). Although this condition alone would encourage strong responses to\nextremely low values of input stimulus, an undesirable situation, the combination\nof the constraint and the monotonicity of the response functions ensure that this\ncannot occur.\nFor the constraint, we demanded that intense unimodal input match observa-\ntions (see Fig. 1c): (1) that intense, pure chordotonal input induced no rolling; and\n(2) intense, pure MD IV input induced a modest, but non-zero, fraction of\nanimals to roll (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We quantified this as:\nh wM,wB\n\u00f0\n\u00de~\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n(gB 0,100; wM,wB\n\u00f0\n\u00de{aNoci)2z(gB 100,0; wM,wB\n\u00f0\n\u00de{aMech)2\nq\nwhere we set aNoci 5 30 and aMech 5 0 (Extended Data Fig. 8e).\nWe then calculated optimal connection weights given neuron thresholds. We\nassumed that the pure mechanosensory interneuron does not have an extremely\nhigh threshold, set hP to a value between 30 and 50 and explored the constrained\noptimization problem for hM and hB values between 10 and 80. For each set of\nparameters, the multilevel convergence solution was defined as the circuit output\ncorresponding to the parameters (wM, wB) that maximize S(wM, wB) subject to\nh(wM, wB) , h0. We similarly defined the early convergence solution as the circuit\nwith the wM that maximizes S(wM, 0) subject to h(wM, 0) , h0. We set h0 5 3 to\nensure strong compliance with our unimodal constraints and numerically com-\nputed and compared solutions across a grid of wB and wB values starting at 0 with\n0.01 spacing (Extended Data Fig. 8f). To check the robustness of early and multi-\nlevel convergence solutions to threshold parameters, we explored multiple values\nof hB and hB (Extended Data Fig. 8g).\n51. Jenett, A. et al.

Line\nthickness qualitatively reflects the probability of the behaviour transition\noccurring in the absence of stimulation (bottom left) and after the onset of MD\nIV activation (orange triangle, bottom right), vibration (green triangle, top left),\nor their combination (black triangle, top right). Behaviours in grey occur with\nextremely low frequency. In response to nociceptive or combined stimulation\nanimals can select one of two types of escapes responses: (1) roll-fast crawl; or\n(2) fast crawl alone. Even in response to combined stimulation the selection is\nprobabilistic; the majority of animals select roll-fast crawl, but some select fast\ncrawl without rolling. f, Crawling stride speed in the absence of stimulation\n(white) and following 1,000 Hz, 6.7 m s22 vibration (green) (in MD IV-\nGAL4.1 larvae); thermogenetic nociceptive activation (32 uC, in MD IV-\nGAL4.UAS-dTRPA1 larvae) (orange); or their combination (grey). In the\nnociceptive and combined condition, we separately analysed the stride speed of\nanimals that did not roll (non-rollers) and those that rolled (rollers) following\nstimulation. As previously described, vibration alone evoked an increase in\nstride speed. Nociceptive activation alone, or in combination with vibration,\nalso evoked an increase in stride speed, both in animals that did not roll and in\nanimals that did roll, after rolling. Combining vibration with nociceptive\nstimulation in animals that selected fast crawl significantly increased stride\nspeed compared to either stimulation alone. Vibration combined with\nnociceptive stimulation therefore affects both aspects of the escapes response,\nfacilitating the triggering of rolling (Fig. 1e, f) and increasing crawling stride\nspeed in animals that do not roll.

Three distinct short-range\ninterneuron types (A02m, A02n and A10a) received at least two synapses from\nnociceptive sensory neurons in both animals. A02m/n and A10a neurons also\nreceived inputs from Basin-2 or Basin-4 (Supplementary Information\n(Supplementary Atlas section)). The two interneurons A02m and A02n belong\nto the same lineage (lineage 2), have indistinguishable projections and\nconnectivity, and can only be distinguished based on a small difference in the\ndorsoventral cell body location. In contrast, Basin-1, Basin-2, Basin-3 and\nBasin-4, even though they belong to the same lineage (lineage 9), all have\ndistinct projections (and connectivity) and can each be considered a unique\nneuron type. A10a also have unique projections and belong to lineage 10.\nb, Total number of inputs each neuron in a receives. c, Reproducibility of\nconnections between neuron types across individuals.

Values given are\nthe total sum of all synapses for all members of each class. 100% of connections\nwith at least two synapses between homologous neuron types that were\nreproducible across the same individual were also reproducible across\nindividuals; that is, the connection between those neurons existed in the other\nindividual. d, Reproducibility of connections between individual neurons\nacross individuals.

We observe that in control larvae,\nred light alone evoked a mild reduction in crawling speed, whereas Basin-1\nactivation evoked a mild, but significant, increase in stride speed and did not\nevoke rolling. Basin-4 activation evoked the entire escape sequence (roll\nfollowed by fast crawl). Note first an increase in instantaneous percentage of\nrolling larvae (peak in green line in a), followed by an increase in the\ninstantaneous percentage of crawling larvae, and an increase in stride speed\nrelative to the period prior to stimulation (peak in blue line in a). Goro neuron\nactivation only evoked rolling and not crawling (note the percentage of\ncrawling larvae is almost 0 during the optogenetic activation period).\nFurthermorethere was noincrease in relativestridespeedfollowing stimulation\noffset. Activation of the three A00c neurons with R71A10 was not sufficient to\nevoke rolling, but it was sufficient to evoke a mild, but significant, increase in\nstride speed.

A benefit of the multilevel architecture could be to\namplify the effect of mechanosensory cues on nociceptive cues, increasing the\nsensitivity to relatively weak bimodal cues. To explore this idea further, we used\na simple model to ask whether a two-level network with two levels of\nconvergence (multilevel convergence; MC) can be more sensitive to relatively\nweak bimodal events than a network with only early convergence (EC).\na, Schematic for a simple model of early and multilevel convergence networks\n(see Methods for details). We considered an early convergence and a multilevel\nconvergence two-layer feed-forward circuit with two inputs, corresponding to\nMD IV (ENoci) and chordotonal (EMech), and one output corresponding to\nrolling occurrence. We modelled steady-state firing rates, where the output of\neach model neuron is a sigmoidal logistic function (with a lower threshold and\nupper saturation) of a weighted sum of its inputs. One pathway remains only\nchordotonal, while the other mixes modalities only early, or at both levels,\ndepending on weights (wM and wB). b\u2013d, Solutions for wM and wB are found\nusing a constrained optimization procedure that maximizes sensitivity to weak\nbimodal inputs (b, c) within two experimentally observed unimodal target\noutputs (d): (1) that mechanosensory stimulus alone never evokes rolling; and\n(2) that the strongest MD IV stimulus alone evokes only 30% output (Fig. 1e, f\nand see Methods for details). e, Example deviation h from target outputs (see\nMethods) for multiple values of wM and wB for one set of thresholds (hp 5 40;\nhM 5 50; hB 5 75). f, Values of wM and wB that maximize sensitivity S (dots)\nwhile also satisfying h , 3 (grey area). g, Early and multilevel solutions (if they\nexist) for other thresholds. Solutions exist if one or both hM or hB is high\n(keeping hp 5 40). Note that although the optimal sensitivity multilevel\nconvergence solution could have wM 5 0 and thus effectively be an early\nconvergence solution, this does not occur; multilevel convergence solutions are\nalways more sensitive when they exist. Multilevel convergence solutions with\nwB 5 0 are not shown since they do not exhibit multilevel convergence.\nh, Sensitivity of the optimal multilevel convergence solution as a function of the\nsame thresholds as in Extended Data Fig. 8g, normalized by the most sensitive\nmultilevel convergence solution found. Multilevel convergence solutions are\nmore sensitive to relatively weak multimodal stimuli than early convergence\nsolutions. Across all thresholds tested, the most sensitive circuits occur for\nhM5 50 and hB 5 75 (Extended Data Fig. 8k). For such parameters, no early\nconvergence solutions satisfy the unimodal constraints, hence multilevel\nconvergence solutions are overall the most sensitive. i, j, Example early\nconvergence and multilevel convergence solutions forwB andwB that satisfy the\ncondition in d for one set of neuronal firing thresholds (hp 5 40; hM 5 50;\nhB 5 75). k, Subtracting the output of early convergence from the multilevel\nconvergence circuit. The multilevel convergence circuit triggers more rolling\nthan the early convergence circuit in response to relatively weak bimodal cues\nand strong unimodal MD IV cues, but less rolling than the early convergence\ncircuit to strong unimodal chordotonal cues (top left corner). The multilevel\nconvergence circuit thus offers a more complex response function with greater\nsensitivity and selectivity for multimodal and strong unimodal MD IV cues, but\nnot chordotonal cues, and could enable enhanced selection of rolling to more\nthreatening events and reduced selection of rolling to less threatening events.\nARTICLE RESEARCH\nG2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the brain, neurons cell bodies are in the outer layer (gray) and project neurits into the\nneuropil. We can distinguish four main classes of neurons: visual projection interneurons (VPN, blue), visual local interneurons (VLN, green), third-order\ninterneurons (gray) and aminergic modulatory neurons (brown). Octopaminergic/tyraminergic modulatory neurons cell bodies sit in the subesophageal\nzone (SEZ). (B) 3D reconstruction of all LON-associated neurons from the ssTEM dataset in both hemispheres (except Bolwig nerves): VLN in green:\nlocal optic lobe pioneer neurons (lOLPs); VPN in shades of blue: the projection OLP (pOLP), a novel neuron which is located in the posterior ventral\nlateral cortex (PVL09), the Pdf-lateral neurons (Pdf-LaNs), the 5th-LaN and the non-clock-LaNs (nc-LaNs); third-order neurons: VPLN in light brown and\nTiny VLN in gray; aminergic modulatory neurons: serotonergic neuron (SP2-1, orange) and SEZ-ventral-unpaired-medial-2 octopaminergic/tyraminergic\nneurons (sVUM2, brown). Posterior view. (C\u2013K) 3D reconstructions from ssTEM dataset, posterior view, dendrites in blue, axons in green, presynaptic\nsites in red, postsynaptic sites in cyan, other LON neurons in gray. VLP: ventral lateral protocerebrum. SLP: superior lateral protocerebrum. LIP: lateral\ninferior protocerebrum. Both lOLPs (cha-lOLP (C) and glu-lOLP (D)) have dense arborizations within the LON. (E) The pOLP cell body is situated with\nthe lOLP and projects to the VLP. (F) PVL09 cell body is situated postero-ventro-laterally to the LON and has an axon with a characteristic loop shape,\nextending first towards the ventro-medial protocerebrum, then towards the LIP before curving down back to the VLP, where it forms most of its\nsynaptic output. (G) The four Pdf-LaNs project to the SLP. (H) The 5th-LaN projects both to the SLP and the LIP region, whereas nc-LaN 1 and 2 (I and\nJ) mainly project to the LIP.

(A) Rh6-PRs presynaptic terminals (dark green) define a distal LON layer (LONd) while Rh5-PRs presynaptic connections (dark blue)\ndefine an intermediate LON layer (LONi). A third layer of the LON, more proximal (LONp) is devoid of PR terminals. Other LON neurons in gray. (B) All\nLON layers, including the LONp, contain presynaptic sites from the lOLPs (skeletons in green, synapses in yellow). VPNs, Tiny VLN and Bolwig nerve in\ngray. (C) VPNs (blue) make synaptic connections in three main regions outside the LON. VPNs projections define three domains: dorsal domain (A,\nviolet) defined by projections in the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP), lateral domain (B, orange) in the lateral inferior protocerebrum (LIP), ventral\ndomain (C, red) in the ventral lateral protocerebrum (VLP). VLNs and Bolwig nerve in gray. (D) Schematic of the LON three layers: LONd innervated by\nRh6-PRs (dark green), LONi innervated by Rh5-PRs (dark blue) and LONp innervated by lOLPs (green); and of the three domains outside the LON were\ndifferent VPNs subtypes project to (violet, orange and red empty circles). lOLPs also make presynaptic connections in the LONd and LONi (thick line).\n(E) Connectivity table of the left LON with the percentage of postsynaptic sites of a neuron in a column from a neuron in a row. Neurons of same type\nare grouped, in brackets number of neurons in the group. Same colors as in Figure 1B. Only connections with at least two synapses found in both\nhemispheres were used. (F) Simplified diagram of the larval visual system. PRs inputs are cholinergic and define two pathways. Rh5-PRs target VPNs\n(blue area, LONi) while Rh6-PRs target the two main larval VLNs (green area, LONd). Between these two VLNs, one is cholinergic while the other one is\nglutamatergic and they both inputs onto VPNs. These VLNs also integrate aminergic modulatory inputs (brown area) that potentially bring information\nfrom the central brain. In the LONp, the two third-order neurons receive from the lOLPs. The third-order neuron VPLN, which is glutamatergic,\nadditionally receives from the serotonergic neuron, connects onto the VPNs and also projects towards the central brain (gray area) like other VPNs.\nBlack arrows: cholinergic connections.

The two lOLPs receives from Rh6-PRs (dark green) and are\nreciprocally connected. They also share the same type of targets: VPNs (blue) including PVL09, all LaNs and the VPLN, that are direct targets of Rh5-PRs\n(dark blue) (except the VPLN) and are outputs of the LON towards the central brain. (B) The four Pdf-LaNs are the only VPNs that receive from both\nRh6-PRs and Rh5-PRs. The VPLN is a third-order neuron that does not receive any inputs from PRs. All other VPNs receive visual inputs uniquely from\nRh5-PRs. All inputs from PRs onto VPNs are situated on the target dendrites. (C) VPNs, except pOLP, are targets of the two lOLPs and these\nconnections are situated on the VPNs dendrites. Additionally, PVL09 receives inputs from both the VPLN and nc-LaN one while the Pdf-LaNs receive\nonly from the nc-LaN 1, and the 5th-LaN receive only from the VPLN. PVL09 and pOLP are reciprocally connected on their axons. All VPNs transfer light\ninformation to neurons deeper in the brain.

Cell filled\ncolor represents the neurotransmitter/neuropeptide expression: yellow for cholinergic cells, red for glutamatergic cells, brown for octopaminergic/\ntyraminergic cells, light orange for serotonergic cell, pink for Pdf neuropeptide. Each PRs subtypes have specific targets. Rh6-PRs (dark green) mainly\ncontact the two lOLPs while Rh5-PRs (dark blue) contact VPNs. Only the Pdf-LaNs receive inputs from both PRs and therefore could be placed at the\nlimit between both Rh6-PRs and Rh5-PRs pathways (green and blue areas, also corresponding to LONdistal (LONd) and LONintermediate (LONi)\nlayers). All PRs neurons are cholinergic (Yasuyama et al., 1995; Keene et al., 2011). sVUM2 neurons (brown) are octopaminergic/tyraminergic. SP2-1\n(orange) is serotonergic. One lOLP (light green) is cholinergic while the other one is glutamatergic. VPNs (shades of blue): pOLP and PVL09 are\ncholinergic; Pdf-LaNs express the Pdf neuropeptide and may co-express glycine (Frenkel et al., 2017); both nc-LaNs and the 5th-LaN are cholinergic.\nThe third-order neuron VPLN (light brown) is glutamatergic and receives its inputs in the LONproximal layer (LONp, stronger gray area). For simplicity,\nthe 5th-LaN and the two nc-LaNs are grouped together. Both lOLPs form a reciprocally connected pair that modulates almost all other VPNs. The\nVPLN also modulates the 5th/nc-LaNs group as well as PVL09. nc-LaN1 additionally connects onto the Pdf-LaNs, and both nc-LaNs connect onto the\nVPLN. pOLP is the only VPN that is not modulated by other visual interneurons, except for its strong reciprocal connections with PVL09 at their axonal\nlevel. The three aminergic neurons (brown area) target mainly the two lOLPs and SP2-1 further connect onto the VPLN. Black arrows represent\nconnections within LON neurons while gray arrows represent connections beyond. Additional external inputs onto some VPNs are not represented\nhere. Arrow thickness weighted by the square root of the number of synapses, arrow thickness scale shows minimum and maximum.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387.013\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

(A) We compared the structure of the left (L) and right (R) LON circuits with spectral graph analysis. For\nthe left and right connectivity matrices, we plotted the components of the first nonzero eigenvector of the graph\nLaplacian associated with each neuron (x axis) as a function of the signal flow metric (y axis), measures that reflect\nthe topological role of neurons in the circuit (Varshney et al., 2011). We excluded the neuromodulatory neurons\nSP2-1, which are weakly connected, and the sVUM2md and sVUM2mx, which project bilaterally. Visual information\nflows from PRs at the top towards VPNs at the bottom. In this representation, bilaterally homologous neurons\nshare a similar position revealing that both sides have similar network topology (Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016).\nFigure 5 continued on next page\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

Comparison of the structural organization and putative functions of the Drosophila larval visual circuit with the Drosophila adult compound\neye and the vertebrate visual circuit. (A) Larval visual circuit as described in this paper. Two main groups of VPNs receive input from Rh5-PRs (purple):\none corresponds to the pOLP that only receives inputs from Rh5-PRs, whereas the second group (VPN) also receives inputs from cha and glu -lOLPs\n(red and blue) that are targets of Rh6-PRs (orange). The third-order neuron VPLN does not receive from either larval PRs but is downstream of the two\nlOLPs and connect onto the VPN group in top of its projection beyond the LON. We propose that cha and glu -lOLPs control light intensity increment\nand decrement (ON/OFF) detection respectively and transfer these information to the VPLN and the VPN group. Moreover, the VPLN may potentially\nkeep the ON/OFF responses brief. (B) Model of a single unit of the fly compound eye where R1-6 PRs (orange) are well known to be involved in\ncontrast and motion detection, whereas R7-8 PRs (purple) are involved in color sensing (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016, for\nreviews). In the lamina, R1-6 PRs make connections to the glutamatergic L1 neuron controlling the ON pathway (red) and to the cholinergic L2 neuron\ncontrolling the OFF pathway (blue). In the deeper medulla, L1 and L2 reach their targets (Mi1, Tm1/2), whereas R7-8 PRs connect to medullar neurons\n(Dm/Mi). (C) Model of the vertebrate visual circuit (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016), for reviews). Cones (purple), which are also the\ncolor sensors of the retina, connect to bipolar retinal cells (BPC) which constitute the ON or OFF pathways depending on the glutamate receptor they\nexpress (ON BPC and pathway in red, OFF BPC and pathway in blue). Rods (orange) also connect to BPC and control vision in dim light conditions.\nLONd, LONi and LONp: distal, intermediate and proximal larval optic neuropil.

Here, we describe the circuit architecture of\nthe visual system of Drosophila larvae by mapping the synaptic wiring diagram and\nneurotransmitters. By contacting different targets, the two larval PR-subtypes create two\nconverging pathways potentially underlying the computation of ambient light intensity and\ntemporal light changes already within this first visual processing center.

The stratified structure of the larval optic neuropil (LON)\nsuggests common organizational principles with the adult fly and vertebrate visual systems. The\ncomplete synaptic wiring diagram of the LON paves the way to understanding how circuits with\nreduced numerical complexity control wide ranges of behaviors.\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387.001\nIntroduction\nLight-dependent cues from the surrounding world are perceived by specialized photoreceptor neu-\nrons (PRs) in the eye. Insect compound eyes are elaborate systems capable of mediating flight in a\nrapidly changing 3D environment. In contrast, larval stages present much simpler visual organs,\nwhich combined with their tractability, make them great models to link neural circuit processing and\nbehavior (Kane et al., 2013; Randel et al., 2014; 2015; Gepner et al., 2015). Larvae of the fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster employ their visual system for a range of diverse behaviors including navi-\ngation, entrainment of circadian rhythms, formation of associative memories and may respond to the\npresence of other larvae (Kane et al., 2013; Humberg and Sprecher, 2017; Slepian et al., 2015;\nJustice et al., 2012; Yamanaka et al., 2013; von Essen et al., 2011; Gong, 2009; Mazzoni et al.,\n2005; Gerber et al., 2004; Sawin-McCormack et al., 1995). The simple eyes of the larva (also\ntermed Bolwig Organ, BO) consist of only about 12 PRs each and yet drive a wide range of behav-\niors, raising questions on the organizational logic of the underlying visual circuit. Spectral sensitivity\nof PRs is defined by the Rhodopsin gene they express. Larval eyes contain two PR-types, either\nexpressing the blue-tuned Rhodopsin5 (Rh5) or the green-tuned Rhodopsin6 (Rh6) (Malpel et al.,\n2002; Hassan et al., 2005; Rodriguez Moncalvo and Campos, 2005; Sprecher et al., 2007). Inter-\nestingly, for rapid navigation away from light exposure only the Rh5-PRs seem essential, whereas to\nentrain the molecular clock either PR subtype suffices (Keene et al., 2011). In the past, several neu-\nrons of the larval visual neural circuit have been identified but the logic of circuit wiring as well as\nthe precise numbers of neurons involved in its first order visual processing center remain unknown.\nLarval PRs project their axons in a joint nerve (Bolwig nerve) terminating in a small neuropil\ndomain termed the larval optic neuropil (LON). Previous studies identified eleven neurons\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387\n1 of 23\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\n",

        "full_text": "innervating the LON in each brain hemisphere. This includes four lateral neurons (LaNs) expressing\nthe pigment dispersing factor (Pdf) neuropeptide (Pdf-LaNs) and a fifth non-Pdf-expressing LaN\n(5th-LaN), all being part of the clock circuit (Kaneko et al., 1997), as well as a serotonergic neuron\nand three optic lobe pioneer cells (OLPs) (Helfrich-Fo\u00a8rster, 1997; Rodriguez Moncalvo and Cam-\npos, 2005; 2009; Tix et al., 1989). Recently, two unpaired median octopaminergic/tyraminergic\nneurons were described to extend neurites into these neuropils (Selcho et al., 2014). It remained\nunknown, however, whether these previously identified neurons constitute the entire neuronal com-\nponents of the LON and how visual neuronal components connect to each other to form a functional\nnetwork. In a recent study we started to investigate the anatomy of the LON using serial-section\ntransmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) showing that PRs\u2019 axons form large globular boutons with\npolyadic synapses and that the OLPs were parts of their direct targets (Sprecher et al., 2011).\nHere, we mapped the synaptic wiring diagram of the LON by reconstructing all its innervating\nneurons from a new ssTEM volume of a whole first instar larval central nervous system\n(Ohyama et al., 2015). We characterized and quantified the connectivity of all previously described\nLON-associated neurons and identified new components in this circuit. We found per hemisphere\neleven second order interneurons, two third-order interneurons and one serotonergic neuron inner-\nvating the LON, plus two unpaired octopaminergic/tyraminergic neurons contacting both hemi-\nspheres. We highlighted the separation of light signal flow at the first synapse level as the two PR\nsubtypes connect onto distinct subsets of interneurons. Network analysis suggests that the resulting\ncircuits may encode both ambient light intensity information and information about the changes of\nlight intensity. Comparison with the visual circuit of the adult fruit fly highlights common principles in\norganization of visual information processing, for example the stratification of PRs inputs as well as\nthe existence of distinct photoreceptor pathways that are involved in detecting temporal light cues.\nFurthermore, the comparison with the olfactory wiring diagram (Berck et al., 2016) highlights com-\nmon strategies for early sensory information processing, relay to higher order areas such as the\nmushroom bodies for associative memory, and control from the central brain. By mapping the con-\nnectivity of visual circuits and analyzing its architecture we have the opportunity to study the circuit\nstructure-function relationship and advance our understanding of how neural circuits govern\nbehavior.\nResults\nNeurons of the larval visual circuit\nAxonal projections of larval photoreceptor neurons (PRs) enter the brain lobes ventro-laterally via\nthe Bolwig nerve and terminate in a small neuropil domain, termed larval optic neuropil (LON;\nFigure 1A,B, Figure 1\u2014video 1). Visual interneurons innervate the LON from the central brain\nthrough the central optic tract (Sprecher et al., 2011). We reconstructed the axon terminals of all\nPRs and all their synaptic partners, as well as additional LON-innervating neurons that do not form\nsynapses with PRs, from a serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume spanning\nthe complete central nervous system of a Drosophila first instar larva (using the Collaborative Anno-\ntation Toolkit for Massive Amounts of Image Data (CATMAID), Saalfeld et al. (2009); Ohyama et al.\n(2015); Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016). In this way, we identified the complete repertoire of LON\nneurons and mapped the wiring diagram of the left and right LONs.\nWe define five neuron types (Figure 1A,B): first, sensory neurons (photoreceptor neurons) that\ninnervate the LON; second, visual local interneurons (VLNs) that do not extend neurites beyond the\nLON; third, visual projection interneurons (VPNs) that relay signals from the LON to distinct higher\nbrain areas; fourth, third-order interneurons in the LON that do not receive direct input from the\nPRs; and fifth, modulatory aminergic feedback neurons projecting from the central brain.\nTwo interneurons belonging to the previously described optic lobe pioneer cells (OLPs, Tix et al.,\n1989) are VLNs, which we therefore named local-OLPs (lOLPs). Their arbors are fully contained\nwithin the LON and they present a distinct axon and dendrite (Figure 1C,D), comparable to gluta-\nmatergic inhibitory neurons of the larval antennal lobe (Berck et al., 2016). We found that one lOLP\nis cholinergic (cha-lOLP) while the other is glutamatergic (glu-lOLP), in agreement with previous\nstudies (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; Yasuyama et al., 1995; Daniels et al., 2008).\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

In addition, in the VPN group we newly identified two non-\nclock lateral neurons (nc-LaNs) originating from the same neuroblast lineage as the 5th-LaN\n(Figure 1I,J; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1), and one neuron defined by its \u2018postero-ventro-lateral\u2019\ncell body position, termed PVL09 (Figure 1F). All these VPNs, except the four peptidergic Pdf-LaNs,\nare cholinergic (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).\nWe also identified two third-order interneurons that make connections within the LON but do not\nreceive direct inputs from PRs. The first one, is defined by prominent axonal projections beyond the\nLON and significant pre-synaptic termini within the LON. We therefore named this neuron visual pro-\njection-local interneuron (VPLN, Figure 1K). We found that the VPLN is glutamatergic (Figure 1\u2014\nfigure supplement 1). The second third-order interneuron is a VLN that we named Tiny VLN\nbecause of its small size in the current dataset (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2; no additional infor-\nmation could be collected as no known GAL4 line labels this cell).\nFinally, LON circuits are modulated from the central brain by a bilateral pair of serotonergic neu-\nrons and two ventral-unpaired-medial neurons of the subesophageal zone that are octopaminergic/\ntyraminergic\nand\nthat\nproject\nbilaterally\nto\nboth\nLONs\n(see\nbelow,\nHuser\net\nal.,\n2012;\nRodriguez Moncalvo and Campos, 2009; Selcho et al., 2014). These neurons match in number and\nneuromodulator type with the left-right pair of serotonergic neurons and the two bilateral octopami-\nnergic neurons of the larval antennal lobe (Berck et al., 2016), providing support for an ancestral\nFigure 1 continued\nWe can distinguish four main classes of neurons: visual projection interneurons (VPN, blue), visual local\ninterneurons (VLN, green), third-order interneurons (gray) and aminergic modulatory neurons (brown).\nOctopaminergic/tyraminergic modulatory neurons cell bodies sit in the subesophageal zone (SEZ).

        "full_text": "common organization of the visual and the olfactory sensory neuropils (Strausfeld, 1989;\nStrausfeld et al., 2007).\nWith the exception of the unpaired octopaminergic/tyraminergic neurons, we identified in all\ncases pairs of bilaterally homologous VLNs and VPNs. In addition, in the right brain hemisphere we\nfound an additional fourth OLP, which, together with the variable number of PRs, suggests that the\ncircuit architecture can accommodate a variable number of neurons (see below).\nThe larval optic neuropil is organized in three layers\nVisual circuits in the mammalian retina as well as in the optic ganglia of the adult fruit fly are orga-\nnized in layers. These layers are characterized by dendritic arborizations or axonal termini of specific\nneuron types (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010). In Drosophila larvae, the LON can be subdivided into\nthree distinct layers based on the innervation of the PR subtypes, which allows to distinguish them in\nthe ssTEM dataset (Sprecher et al., 2011). Briefly, Rhodopsin6-PRs (Rh6-PRs) terminate in the distal,\nmost outer layer of the LON (LONd), whereas Rhodopsin5-PRs (Rh5-PRs) terminate in the intermedi-\nate LON layer (LONi). The most proximal, inner layer of the LON (LONp) lacks direct PRs input\n(Figure 2A\u2013C).\nThe layered arrangement of PRs\u2019 axon terminals translates into specific connectivity with LON\nneurons. Most VPNs, whose dendrites do not reach the LONd, receive direct inputs from Rh5-PRs\nonly, whereas the dendrites of Pdf-LaNs span both the LONd and LONi, integrating inputs from\nboth Rh5- and Rh6-PRs (see below; Figure 1E\u2013K). The absence of PRs\u2019 axon terminals in the LONp\ndeprives the third-order interneurons, VPLN and Tiny VLN, whose dendrites are restricted to the\nLONp, from any direct PRs inputs (Figures 1K and 2F). Intriguingly, the Tiny VLN integrates inputs\nwithin the LONp and projects back to both LONi and LONd (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2).\nBeyond the LON, VPNs\u2019 axons target three distinct protocerebral areas, namely the superior lat-\neral protocerebrum, the lateral inferior protocerebrum and the ventro lateral protocerebrum\n(Figure 2C,D). Interestingly, these areas overlap in parts with the lateral horn, involved in innate\nbehaviors, and the mushroom body calyx, involved in associative memory (see below). Within the\nLON, the dendrites of VPNs are mainly postsynaptic, whereas their axons, upon reaching higher\nbrain areas, present both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (Figure 1E\u2013K). This suggests that VPNs\noutputs are modulated by input from non-visual neurons, similarly to how olfactory projection inter-\nneurons receive non-olfactory inputs (Berck et al., 2016). In particular pOLP and the VPLN receive\nup to 30% of their inputs from non-LON neurons (Figure 2E).\nTwo light input pathways: each PR subtype targets distinct VPNs and\nVLNs\nPrevious studies suggested that only Rh5-PRs are critical for rapid light avoidance, while Rh6-PRs\nappeared non-essential (Keene et al., 2011; Kane et al., 2013). However, for entrainment of the\nmolecular clock either PR-type by itself is sufficient (Keene et al., 2011). These findings lead us to\nspeculate that Rh5-PRs and Rh6-PRs connect to distinct types of visual interneurons. Supporting this\nnotion, we found that Rh6-PRs synapse principally onto VLNs (79%) and much less onto VPNs (15%,\nall onto one single VPN type: the Pdf-LaNs; Figure 2E, Figure 2\u2014source data 1). Conversely, Rh5-\nPRs preferentially synapse onto VPNs (90%) and much less onto VLNs (6%). An exception to this seg-\nregation of PRs inputs are the Pdf-expressing LaNs of the clock circuits. Indeed, the four Pdf-LaNs\nare the only interneurons that receive direct inputs from both Rh6-PRs and Rh5-PRs (20% from Rh6-\nPRs and 15% from Rh5-PRs, Figures 2E and 3B), supporting behavioral evidence that either PR-sub-\ntype may entrain the larval clock (Keene et al., 2011).\nRh6-PRs target the two main VLNs of the LON: the cha- and glu-lOLPs (Figures 2E,F and\n3A). Furthermore, the lOLPs main inputs come from Rh6-PRs: up to 75% of cha-OLP input and 58%\nof glu-lOLP input. Importantly, these two VLNs synapse onto most VPNs including the four Pdf-LaNs\nand the 5th-LaN of the circadian clock, the nc-LaNs, PVL09 and the third-order interneuron VPLN\n(Figure 3C). pOLP is the only VPN that does not receive inputs from its sister cells, the two lOLPs,\nand therefore create a direct output pathway of the Rh5-PRs light dependent information towards\nhigher brain regions (Figure 3B,C). pOLP is strongly interconnected through axo-axonic connections\nwith PVL09 suggesting that they may reciprocally cross-modulate their synaptic output (Figures 2E\nand 3C; Figure 2\u2014source data 2). Also, the 5th-LaN and the two nc-LaNs, present different\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28387\n5 of 23\nResearch article\nNeuroscience\n",

        "full_text": "modulation from this cell (see discussion, Figures 2E and 3C).\nThe third-order interneuron VPLN, which does not receive direct inputs from PRs (Figure 3B), is\ndownstream of the two lOLPs and is itself connecting onto several VPNs including the 5th-LaN, the\ntwo nc-LaNs and PVL09 creating another layer of possible computation (see discussion, Figure 3C\u2013\nE).\nIn summary, most VPNs that directly integrate Rh5-PRs light dependent information may be mod-\nulated indirectly by the Rh6-PRs light dependent information via the two VLNs, cha- and glu-lOLPs\n(see discussion, Figures 2F and 3A).\nVPNs target different brain areas\nDistinct areas of the protocerebrum are innervated by the six unique VPNs of the larval visual circuit\n(the pOLP, the 5th-LaN, the two nc-LaNs, the third-order interneuron VPLN, and PVL09) and by the\nfour Pdf-LaNs of the circadian clock.\npOLP targets the lower lateral horn, an area also innervated by the multiglomerular olfactory pro-\njection interneuron (mPN) Seahorse (Berck et al., 2016; Figure 1E, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3)\nwith whom it shares numerous postsynaptic partners (data not shown). Since mPN Seahorse integra-\ntes inputs from the aversive OR82a-expressing olfactory receptor neuron (Kreher et al., 2008),\ndownstream neurons of pOLP and mPN Seahorse are likely contributing to aversive behavior.\nThree sister VPNs (the 5th-LaN and both nc-LaN 1 and 2) present similar axon trajectories, drop-\nping synapses in the lateral horn until reaching the accessory calyx of the mushroom body\n(Figure\n1H\u2013J,\nFigure\n1\u2014figure\nsupplement\n3),\nwhere\nthey\nsynapse\nonto\nKenyon\ncells\n(Eichler et al., 2017). On top of its local connections and potential local function (see discussion),\nthe VPLN also has projections beyond the LON in a similar pattern as both nc-LaNs (Figure 1K, Fig-\nure 1\u2014figure supplement 3).\nPVL09 is unique among the VPNs in presenting a bifurcated axon with one branch following the\nother VPNs into the lateral horn and the other branch taking a long looping path below the mush-\nroom body before coming back to the same region as pOLP (Figure 1F, Figure 1\u2014figure supple-\nment 3). Like most VPNs, PVL09 is under the control of the two lOLPs and the VPLN, but\nadditionally receives inputs from both nc-LaNs on its dendrites and axon (Figure 3\u2014figure supple-\nment 1; Figure 2\u2014source data 2), suggesting that it integrates broadly all light information.\nIn summary, all six unique VPNs form synapses in the lateral horn, and three of them (the 5th-\nLaN, nc-LaN one and nc-LaN 2) synapse onto both the lateral horn and the mushroom body Kenyon\ncells (Eichler et al., 2017). VPN connections onto Kenyon cells may underlie the larval ability to form\nassociative memories with light as a conditioned stimulus, whereas light as an unconditioned stimu-\nlus could be encoded via their connections onto the lateral horn (von Essen et al., 2011).\nFinally, the Pdf-LaNs, necessary for circadian rhythm, project to a region dorsal and more medial\nto the lateral horn, similarly as in adult Drosophila (Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010), where\nthey make few small dyadic synapses from boutons rich in dense-core vesicles (Figure 1G, Fig-\nure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 3). Pdf-LaNs boutons also contain clear vesicles suggesting that\nthey might co-express a neurotransmitter, which in adult flies has been suggested to be glycine (Fig-\nure 1\u2014figure supplement 1; Frenkel et al., 2017).\nCentral brain feedback via octopaminergic/tyraminergic and\nserotonergic neurons\nSimilarly to other sensory modalities (Roy et al., 2007; Dacks et al., 2009; Huser et al., 2012;\nSelcho et al., 2014; Majeed et al., 2016; Berck et al., 2016), a set of aminergic neurons provide\nfeedback from the central brain into the LON, thus creating an entry point to modulate visual infor-\nmation processing. Both types of modulatory neurons have previously been identified in the LON\n(Rodriguez Moncalvo and Campos, 2005; Huser et al., 2012; Selcho et al., 2014).\nA pair of serotonergic neurons belonging to the SP2 cluster (named SP2-1) connects to the con-\ntralateral LON, while receiving presynaptic input predominantly in the ipsilateral protocerebrum\n(Figure 4A, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). The two other aminergic input neurons are the octo-\npaminergic/tyraminergic subesophageal zone-ventral-unpaired-medial 2 neurons of the maxillary\nand mandibular clusters (sVUM2mx and sVUM2md, Figure 4B,C, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1).\nEach sVUM2 innervates both brain hemispheres in a symmetric fashion.\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

        "full_text": "Each SP2-1 neuron connects to the main VLNs (cha- and glu-lOLPs) as well as to the third-order\ninterneuron VPLN of the contralateral side (Figure 4D). The octopaminergic/tyraminergic sVUM2\nneurons uniquely synapse onto the two lOLPs but in both hemispheres simultaneously (Figure 4E).\nIn contrast to the SP2-1, the lOLPs form feedback synapses onto the axonal termini of both sVUM2\nneurons. This feedback motif may allow local tuning of the octopaminergic/tyraminergic modulatory\ninput, whereas the serotonergic input is not altered within the LON.\nIn summary, SP2-1 and sVUM2 mediate feedback from other brain areas to potentially modulate\nthe activity of the two lOLPs of the Rh6-PRs-VLNs pathway and, in case of the SP2-1, may further\naffect the VPLN. These possible modulations arise from monosynaptic connections between the ami-\nnergic cells with these three visual interneurons, while additional effects might be elicited by volume\nrelease of serotonin and octopamine (Dacks et al., 2009; Linster and Smith, 1997; Selcho et al.,\n2012). Further reconstruction is needed to identify the presynaptic inputs of these aminergic modu-\nlatory neurons.\nBilaterally symmetric LON circuits with asymmetric numbers of neurons\nSimilarly to the non-stereotypic number of ommatidia in the compound eye of the adult fly\n(Ready et al., 1976), the precise number of PRs in each larval eye also varies (Sprecher et al.,\n2007). In the current specimen, we identified thirteen PRs in the left hemisphere and sixteen in the\nright hemisphere. We found four Rh5-PRs and nine Rh6-PRs in the left hemisphere, and six Rh5-PRs\nand ten Rh6-PRs in the right hemisphere. Despite this difference in PRs number, homologous LON\ninterneurons in each hemisphere receive a similar fraction of inputs from PRs (Figure 5\u2014figure sup-\nplement 1), similarly to olfactory projection interneurons that receive an equivalent fraction of inputs\nfrom olfactory receptor neuron despite differences in the numbers of these sensory neurons\n(Tobin et al., 2017). This further supports the idea that projection interneurons may regulate the\namount of inputs from sensory neurons that they receive relative to the total inputs on their\ndendrites.\nInterestingly, we found a third local-OLP in the right brain hemisphere. Similarly to a non-stereo-\ntypic PRs number, variability in OLPs number has been observed before (Tix et al., 1989). When\nusing a GAL4 driver labeling glutamatergic neurons (OK371; Mahr and Aberle, 2005) we found an\nextra-glutamatergic-OLP (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1) at a similar frequency as the presence of\nthe fourth OLP cell had been reported (in about 5% of brains) and displaying an asymmetry between\nhemispheres. It is unusual to have variability and asymmetries in Drosophila neural circuits\n(Ohyama et al., 2015; Berck et al., 2016; Schlegel et al., 2016; Jovanic et al., 2016; Schneider-\nMizell et al., 2016) but it has been observed before (Takemura et al., 2015; Tobin et al., 2017;\nEichler et al., 2017). The presence of an extra-glu-lOLP and variable numbers of PR raises the ques-\ntion of the overall stereotypy of circuit architecture when comparing the left and right LONs.\nWe analyzed the structure of the left and right LONs circuits with spectral graph analysis of the\nconnectivity matrices by plotting the graph partition metric as a function of the signal flow metric\n(Varshney et al., 2011). Despite the left and right LONs not sharing any interneurons and having a\ndifferent number of PR and lOLP cells, we observed that neurons of the same type cluster closely\ntogether (Figure 5A), indicating that the circuit structure in which each identified cell is embedded\nis very similar in the both hemispheres. The position of the extra-lOLP in this spectral graph analysis\nplot and its choice of pre- and postsynaptic partners (Figure 5B), in particular the many inputs from\nRh6-PRs and cha-lOLP, suggest that the extra-lOLP may act as an extra-glu-lOLP, in agreement with\nits inclusion in the OK371-GAL4 expression pattern. Its reciprocal connections with the Tiny VLN are\nalso in favor of this hypothesis (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2). Note though that this extra-glu-\nlOLP also receives some inputs from Rh5-PRs and lacks inputs from the serotonergic neuron unlike\nother lOLPs, which indicates that it might still act differently than a glu-lOLP. Why some larvae pres-\nent this additional cell remains to be determined. Importantly, connections among other LON neu-\nrons do not seem affected by the presence of an extra-glu-lOLP (Figure 5B; Figure 5\u2014figure\nsupplement 1). In conclusion, while the number of PRs and VLNs can vary in the larval visual system,\nthe overall circuit architecture is maintained, and in particular the output channels (VPNs) are\nidentical.\nLarderet et al. eLife 2017;6:e28387.

        "full_text": "Discussion\nA shared characteristic of many visual systems is the retinotopic organization allowing visual process-\ning in a spatially segregated fashion by the transformation of the surrounding environment into a 2D\nvirtual map (for review, Sanes and Zipursky, 2010). Within the compound eye of the adult fruit fly,\nthis is achieved by the prominent organization of PRs in ommatidia in the retina that is maintained\nthrough underlying cartridges in the lamina and columns in the medulla. The Drosophila larval eye\nlacks ommatidia or a similar spatial organization of PRs. Nevertheless larvae can navigate directional\nlight gradients and form light associative memories using their simple eyes (Kane et al., 2013;\nvon Essen et al., 2011; Humberg and Sprecher, 2017).\nIn this study, we described the synapse-level connectome of the larval first visual center by recon-\nstructing neurons recursively from the optic nerves to third-order neurons following all chemical syn-\napses in a nanometer-resolution EM volume of the whole central nervous system. We found that the\ntwo PR subtypes synapse onto distinct target interneurons, showing a clear separation of visual infor-\nmation flow at the first synapse level. Rh5-PRs predominantly synapse onto VPNs, which transfer\nlight information to distinct regions including the lateral horn and the mushroom body calyx,\nwhereas Rh6-PRs strongly synapse onto two VLNs (cha- and glu-lOLPs). Moreover, the flow of infor-\nmation is convergent as these two main VLNs in turn synapse onto most VPNs. These two main\nVLNs also receive input from both the serotonergic as well as the octopaminergic/tyraminergic sys-\ntems, suggesting that their activity may be modulated by input from central brain circuitry. Thus, a\nkey feature of the larval visual circuit is that the Rh6-PRs-pathway feeds into the Rh5-PRs-pathway,\nsuggesting a tuning function for Rh6-PRs and the two VLNs that also integrate external modulatory\ninputs (Figure 2F; Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). This is not excluding the possibility of electrical\nconnections mediated by gap junctions that are not visible in the ssTEM volume.\nHypothesized functional interpretation of circuit architecture\nThe Rh5-PRs-VPNs pathway may provide information about the ambient\nlight intensity\nLarval PRs responses to light remain currently unknown. Moreover, compared to adult flies PRs, lar-\nval PRs lack a clear rhabdomeric structure, do not present intracellular pigment granules and the Bol-\nwig organ is not equipped with focusing optics or other accessory cells (Green et al., 1993;\nSprecher et al., 2007). Nevertheless, larval PRs express the main actors of the phototransduction\npathway like adult PRs (Rosenbaum et al., 2011; Mishra et al., 2016; Bernardo-Garcia et al.,\n2016). It therefore remains difficult to predict how larval PRs response to light. Larval PRs might\neither adapt and detect the mean light intensity, like adult PRs (for review Clark and Demb, 2016),\nor might detect the absolute light intensity. In either case, one can propose that larval PRs provide\ninformation about the ambient light intensity of the larval environment.\nIn other sensory systems such as the olfactory system of the adult (Rybak et al., 2016) and larval\nDrosophila (Berck et al., 2016) and in the chordotonal mechanosensory systems of the locust\n(Yuan et al., 2011) and Drosophila larva (Ohyama et al., 2015; Jovanic et al., 2016) axonal termi-\nnals of sensory neurons receive abundant inhibitory inputs from central neurons. Such presynaptic\ninhibition of sensory terminals may be employed to mediate lateral inhibition (Wilson and Laurent,\n2005; Olsen and Wilson, 2008), to implement divisive normalization (Olsen et al., 2010) or to\nencode a predicted future stimulation (Wolf and Burrows, 1995).

In dissociated larval Pdf-LaNs, it was shown that\napplying acetylcholine increased their calcium response whereas applying glutamate reduced their\ncalcium response (Wegener et al., 2004; Hamasaka et al., 2007), suggesting that acetylcholine is\nan excitatory neurotransmitter for these cells whereas glutamate would be inhibitory. Acetylcholine\ncan\nact\nas\nan\ninhibitory\nneurotransmitter\nthrough\na\nmetabotropic\nmuscarinic\nreceptor\n(Shinomiya et al., 2014; Ren et al., 2015), however, it more often acts as an excitatory neurotrans-\nmitter in Drosophila (Baines and Bate, 1998; Burrows, 1996). If both cha and glu-lOLPs were to be\nexcitatory, the positive feedback loop between these two cells would likely result in an enhanced\nsignal propagation of Rh6-PRs inputs towards VPNs. Such a positive feedforward feature down-\nstream of the two PR-subtypes could make sense if they detected qualitatively distinct visual features\nsuch as spectral cues or intensity. If for instance Rh6-PRs responded to a vastly distinct light-spec-\ntrum than Rh5-PRs or if Rh6-PRs were low-light sensitive, this positive feedforward loop could result\nin spectral integration or amplification of low-light input. However, absorption spectra of both larval\nPRs are largely overlapping and there is currently no evidence for distinct detection capacities of\nboth PRs (Salcedo et al., 1999; Humberg and Sprecher, 2017). Therefore, in our view a more favor-\nable scenario is that outputs from cha-lOLP are likely excitatory while the outputs from glu-lOLP are\nlikely inhibitory, similarly as glutamate has been found to mediate inhibition in the adult fly lobula\nplate (Mauss et al., 2014) and in the antennal lobe (Liu and Wilson, 2013; Berck et al., 2016).\nTherefore, in Figures 2F and 3 one could interpret cholinergic arrows (black) as excitatory and gluta-\nmatergic arrows (red) as inhibitory (also see Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2).\nIf we consider cha-lOLP as excitatory and glu-lOLP as inhibitory, then Rh6-PRs signals appears to\nbe positively transferred to VPNs only via the cha-lOLP (Figure 3A). In addition, cha-lOLP then\nreceives strong inputs from the inhibitory glu-lOLP (Figures 2E and 3A), which is also almost exclu-\nsively driven by Rh6-PRs inputs. Therefore, this inhibition of glu-lOLP onto cha-lOLP could mediate a\nform of indirect presynaptic inhibition of the Rh6-PRs inputs. This motif made by the cholinergic\nRh6-PRs driving both the cha-lOLP and the glu-lOLP, and with the glu-lOLP inhibiting the cha-lOLP,\ncreates then an incoherent feedforward loop (Alon, 2007). Therefore this motif could make the cha-\nlOLP responsive to the derivative of Rh6-PRs activity, that is to the variations in light intensity. As\ncha-lOLP VLN is likely to be a positive relay of Rh6-PRs inputs onto VPNs, VPNs could therefore\nrespond to increments in light intensity (ON response).\nMoreover, cha-lOLP inputs onto the glu-lOLP and both cha- and glu-lOLPs further connect onto\nthe VPNs. Considering cha-lOLP as excitatory and glu-lOLP as inhibitory, this creates a second inco-\nherent feedforward motif making VPNs potentially responsive to the derivative of cha-lOLP inputs.\nAs cha-lOLP inputs may already represent the first derivative of Rh6-PRs inputs, this second incoher-\nent feedforward motif may therefore make VPNs responsive to the acceleration of light intensity\nraises.\nIn summary, glu-lOLP may provide both presynaptic inhibition of Rh6-PRs inputs by inhibiting the\nrelay neuron cha-lOLP, and postsynaptic inhibition by directly inhibiting most VPNs. Consequently,\nVPNs could respond to the ambient light intensity (from Rh5-PRs) and to the variations of light inten-\nsity (from the Rh6-PRs-VLNs pathway). Interestingly, olfactory projection interneurons in the adult\nDrosophila also respond to a mixture of odorant concentration and of the acceleration of odorant\nconcentration (Kim et al., 2015). Comparable to other sensory system (Klein et al., 2015;\nSchulze et al., 2015), a measure of changes in light intensity over time would enable light gradient\nnavigation (Kane et al., 2013; Humberg and Sprecher, 2017).\nPhasic inhibition could sharpen ON and OFF responses\nIn the wiring diagram, we found a glutamatergic (therefore putatively inhibitory) third-order inter-\nneuron, named VPLN and mainly driven by cha- and glu-OLPs.

        "full_text": "input may be critical for the VPLN function. If cha-lOLP input precedes glu-lOLP input, the VPLN\nmay potentially be activated only upon an increase in light intensity via Rh6-PRs (Figure 3D). This is\nunlike the other glutamatergic interneuron, glu-lOLP, which receives direct inputs from PRs and\ntherefore can be tonically active in the presence of light. The VPLN specifically synapses onto multi-\nple VPNs (the 5th-LaN, the two nc-LaNs and PVL09) and therefore potentially inhibits these cells that\nalso receive strong inputs from glu-lOLP (Figure 3C,E, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1). In conse-\nquence, these VPNs may be subject to tonic inhibition (from glu-lOLP) under constant light condi-\ntions and to phasic inhibition (from the VPLN) upon an increase in Rh6-PRs dependent light intensity.\nTherefore, phasic inhibition from the VPLN may potentially refine the temporal resolution of VPNs\nresponses to increment of light intensity (ON response).\nAn interesting aspect resulting from tonic inhibition of VPNs during constant light stimulation is\nwhat happens when the light intensity decreases (OFF response). Some neurons subject to tonic inhi-\nbition can have a rebound of activity when inhibition is lifted (Marder and Bucher, 2001; Hed-\nwig, 2016). If, via this mechanism, VPNs were to increase their activity upon a decrease in light\nintensity, they would be encoding an OFF response. Potentially all VPNs under tonic inhibition from\nglu-lOLP could have this rebound of activity after a light intensity decrease. Interestingly, two cholin-\nergic VPNs (the nc-LaN 1 and 2) synapse onto the VPLN that could then become more strongly acti-\nvated by the OFF response (Figure 3D, Figure 2\u2014source data 1). As the VPLN is inhibiting several\nVPNs (the 5th-LaN, the two nc-LaNs and PVL09), this could therefore create a second period of pha-\nsic inhibition allowing to maintain these VPNs OFF responses brief.\nIn conclusion, the connectivity of the third-order glutamatergic VPLN putatively inhibitory sug-\ngests that it may refine the temporal resolution of VPNs ON and OFF responses through phasic\ninhibition.\nThe visual circuit supports previous behavioral observations\nIn addition, this complete wiring diagram of the larval visual system can explain why in previous stud-\nies only Rh5-PRs appeared to be required for light avoidance while Rh6-PRs seemed dispensable in\nmost experimental conditions (Keene et al., 2011; Kane et al., 2013; Humberg and Sprecher,\n2017). Moreover, Rh6-PRs mutant larvae were shown to avoid light wavelengths from ultra-violet to\ngreen, supporting the idea that Rh5-PRs respond to a wider range of wavelength of light than only\n\u2018blue\u2019 light (Humberg and Sprecher, 2017; Salcedo et al., 2009). Taken together, our current data\nand the lack of evidence of color vision capability in larvae, we propose that the two larval PRs are\nrather specialized in detection of ambient light intensity and of temporal variations of light intensity.\nBased on our connectomic analysis, when Rh6-PRs are mutated or functionally silenced, Rh5-PRs\nmay still provide light ambient intensity information, and the cholinergic inputs from nc-LaNs onto\nthe glutamatergic VPLN could inhibit the VPNs, computing on its own some response to changes in\nlight intensity. Blocking the VPLN activity in a Rh6-PRs depletion background would allow to study\nwhether ambient light information is sufficient for visual navigation. Moreover, when Rh5-PRs are dis-\nabled, VPNs do not receive ambient light information while potentially being under tonic inhibition\nfrom the glu-lOLP, which therefore could shut down their activity. Given that in Rh5-PRs depletion\nbackground, larval visual responses are highly defective, this further suggests that ON and OFF\nresponses alone are not sufficient to allow larval light avoidance. We therefore propose that it may\nneed both a baseline activity of VPNs, provided by ambient light intensity information, and the mod-\nulations of this baseline activity in response to light intensity variations.\nOnly the Pdf-LaNs involved in circadian rhythm receive direct inputs from both PRs subtypes and\ncan therefore still receive ambient light information in either PRs\u2019 depletion condition. This broad\nlight information integration capacity is in agreement with evidence that both PRs subtypes are suffi-\ncient to entrain the larval clock (Keene et al., 2011). While further reconstructions of their postsyn-\naptic partners are required, the four Pdf-LaNs appear identical in sensory inputs, local connections\nand anatomy, raising the question of what such redundancy would allow.\nComparisons between the larval eye and adult compound eye\nThe basic organization of the visual system in the larva, the adults fly as well as with the visual circuit\nof vertebrates show several similarities and possible shared characteristics (Figure 6).

Moreover, the mode of development of Drosophila larval\nand adult eyes reinforces similarities between Rh5-PRs with an inner-PR type and Rh6-PRs with an\nouter-PR type: in the adult, R8-PR precursors are formed first to recruit outer PRs, likewise in the\nlarva, Rh5-PR precursors develop first and then recruit the Rh6-PRs, in both cases via the EGFR path-\nway (Sprecher et al., 2007). Also, development of both inner PRs and Rh5-PRs depend on the tran-\nscription factors senseless and spalt (Sprecher et al., 2007; Sprecher and Desplan, 2008;\nMishra et al., 2013).

Comparison of the structural organization and putative functions of the Drosophila larval visual circuit with the Drosophila adult compound\neye and the vertebrate visual circuit. (A) Larval visual circuit as described in this paper. Two main groups of VPNs receive input from Rh5-PRs (purple):\none corresponds to the pOLP that only receives inputs from Rh5-PRs, whereas the second group (VPN) also receives inputs from cha and glu -lOLPs\n(red and blue) that are targets of Rh6-PRs (orange). The third-order neuron VPLN does not receive from either larval PRs but is downstream of the two\nlOLPs and connect onto the VPN group in top of its projection beyond the LON. We propose that cha and glu -lOLPs control light intensity increment\nand decrement (ON/OFF) detection respectively and transfer these information to the VPLN and the VPN group. Moreover, the VPLN may potentially\nkeep the ON/OFF responses brief. (B) Model of a single unit of the fly compound eye where R1-6 PRs (orange) are well known to be involved in\ncontrast and motion detection, whereas R7-8 PRs (purple) are involved in color sensing (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016, for\nreviews). In the lamina, R1-6 PRs make connections to the glutamatergic L1 neuron controlling the ON pathway (red) and to the cholinergic L2 neuron\ncontrolling the OFF pathway (blue). In the deeper medulla, L1 and L2 reach their targets (Mi1, Tm1/2), whereas R7-8 PRs connect to medullar neurons\n(Dm/Mi). (C) Model of the vertebrate visual circuit (Sanes and Zipursky, 2010; Clark and Demb, 2016), for reviews). Cones (purple), which are also the\ncolor sensors of the retina, connect to bipolar retinal cells (BPC) which constitute the ON or OFF pathways depending on the glutamate receptor they\nexpress (ON BPC and pathway in red, OFF BPC and pathway in blue).

        "full_text": "onto the LON are also a shared feature with the adult visual system where serotonin has been linked\nto circadian rhythmicity (Yuan et al., 2005) and where visual cues during flight are modulated by\noctopaminergic inputs (Suver et al., 2012; Wasserman et al., 2015). In the LON, our data suggest\nthat the serotonergic neuron SP2-1 and octopaminergic/tyraminergic neurons sVUM might modulate\nthe sensitivity to light increment and decrement (ON/OFF) by directly connecting the cha- and glu-\nlOLPs VLNs. These ON and OFF responses might be further affected by inputs from SP2-1 onto the\nVPLN.\nA potential functional comparison between the larval and the adult visual system emerge from\nthe similar neurotransmitters expressed and the functions proposed for the larval VLNs cha- and glu-\nlOLPs and the adult glutamatergic L1 and cholinergic L2 interneurons of the lamina (Figure 6A,B;\nGao et al., 2008). In the adult fly, the outer R1-6 PRs connect to L1 and L2 interneurons that convey\ndistinct responses to light increment (ON) and decrement (OFF) (Joesch et al., 2010; Clark et al.,\n2011; Strother et al., 2014; Behnia et al., 2014). The adult PRs are histaminergic and induce hyper-\npolarization (inhibition) in both L1 and L2 upon light increment, followed by a rebound of activity of\nthese two cells upon light decrement (Hardie, 1987; Reiff et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2011); reviewed\nin Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015). Therefore upon light increment, PRs inhibit the glutamatergic\nL1, which results in the disinhibition of the downstream targets of L1 (ON response). In turn, upon\nlight decrement PRs inhibit the cholinergic L2 less, which results in the activation of the downstream\ntargets of L2 (OFF response). However, the larval PRs are cholinergic (Yasuyama et al., 1995;\nKeene et al., 2011) and, at least for the Pdf-LaNs (Yuan et al., 2011), excite their targets activity in\nresponse of light. Therefore in larvae, an ON response could result from an increase of excitation\nfrom cha-lOLP onto VPNs when light intensity increases (via the increase of Rh6-PRs inputs) and\ncould be kept transient by inhibition from the glu-lOLP (indirect presynaptic inhibition of Rh6-PRs\ninputs) and by phasic inhibition from the VPLN. In turn, an OFF response could result from the disin-\nhibition of VPNs from glu-lOLP inhibition when light intensity decreases and may also be kept tran-\nsient by phasic inhibition from the VPLN. Therefore, whereas the glutamatergic L1 conveys the ON\nresponse and the cholinergic L2 conveys the OFF response in adult flies, we propose that the glu-\nlOLP could convey the OFF response and the cha-lOLP could convey the ON response in larvae\n(Figure 6A,B). Another similarity between the two lOLPs and the adult L1 and L2 is that each lOLP\nreceives an equivalent number of inputs from each Rh6-PRs (about 20 synapses in average, Fig-\nure 2\u2014source data 1), similarly as adult L1 and L2 receives about 50 inputs from each R1-6 PRs\n(Meinertzhagen, 1989), suggesting that the information transfer could have a similarly high fidelity.\nHowever, while ON/OFF responses in adult flies and vertebrates (Figure 6B,C) are involved in\nmotion detection, such ability within one eye is achieved through downstream direction-sensitive\ncells that integrate information from several points in space (Clark and Demb, 2016). As larval eyes\nlack ommatidia such capacity seems unlikely, however the ON/OFF detection could already suffice\nfor larval visual navigation (Kane et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2015; Schulze et al., 2015;\nHumberg and Sprecher, 2017). Another important difference between the larval and adult systems\nis that in the LON the cha- and glu-lOLPs are strongly interconnected and both input onto the same\ntargets, whereas in the adult fly, the L1 and L2 are not chemically connected (only electrically,\nJoesch et al., 2010) and the ON/OFF pathways are separated for two additional synaptic levels\nbefore converging on direction-sensitive cells in the lobula plate (Takemura et al., 2013; Clark and\nDemb, 2016). Consequently, whereas the adult L1 and L2 have similar responses to light\n(Clark et al., 2011; Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015), the reciprocal connections between cha- and\nglu-lOLPs may uniquely shape the light response of these two cells.\nIf the Rh6-PRs-VLNs pathway contributes indeed to a function related to light increment or decre-\nment remains hypothetical. Moreover, since Rh5-PRs survive metamorphosis giving rise to the adult\nHofbauer-Buchner eyelet, it is possible that the larval visual circuit more closely resembles the eyelet\ncircuitry than the one of the adult compound eye (Sprecher and Desplan, 2008).\nComparison between the visual and the olfactory first-order processing\ncenters\nThe LON neural network presents many similarities with the larval olfactory wiring diagram\n(Berck et al., 2016), favoring a potential common organizational origin of these sensory neuropils as\nsuggested before (Strausfeld, 1989; Strausfeld et al., 2007).

        "full_text": "olfactory receptor neurons that project to the antennal lobe where they contact olfactory projection\ninterneurons and olfactory local interneurons. Similarly to visual circuits, sensory inputs in the anten-\nnal lobe are segregated in olfactory receptor specific domains termed glomeruli (Fishilevich et al.,\n2005; Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2009). Most olfactory receptor neurons and olfactory projection\ninterneurons are cholinergic like PRs and VPNs (Keene et al., 2011; Yasuyama and Salvaterra,\n1999; Python and Stocker, 2002), and we find glutamatergic, potentially inhibitory, local interneur-\nons in both systems (Berck et al., 2016). Reciprocal synapses between cha-lOLP and glu-lOLP in the\nvisual circuit may be functionally equivalent to the connections between some olfactory receptor\nneurons and the glutamatergic Picky olfactory local interneuron 0 of the antennal lobe, suggesting\nthat this reciprocal motif in the LON could indeed contribute to detecting changes in light intensity\nby computing the first derivative of the stimulus (Berck et al., 2016). Additionally, we can observe\npresynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition in both sensory systems while the strategies of implementa-\ntion are somewhat different. Interestingly, we observed that most projection interneurons of both\nsensory systems may bring a mixture of stimulus intensity and acceleration in stimulus intensity to\nthe lateral horn and to the mushroom body calyx (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3; Kim et al.,\n2015). Finally, both sensory systems are modulated by aminergic neurons inputs on specifics local\ninterneurons. Interestingly, both the lOLPs VLNs and the olfactory Broad local interneurons Trio\nform feedback synapses onto the axonal termini of their respective bilateral octopaminergic/tyrami-\nnerigc neurons while this is not the case for serotonergic neurons (Berck et al., 2016).\nConcluding remarks\nIdentification of synaptic connectivity and neurotransmitter identity within the larval visual circuit\nallows us to formulate clear predictions on the response profile and function of individual network\ncomponents. Based on the circuit map we suggest that the Rh6-PRs-VLNs pathway might be\nrequired for the detection of light intensity changes, whereas the Rh5-PRs-VPNs pathway could pro-\nvide direct ambient light intensity information. In the future, behavioral studies or physiological activ-\nity recording of visual circuit neurons will allow to add additional layers onto this functional map.\nMaterials and methods\nssTEM based neuronal reconstruction\nIn order to reconstruct the larval visual system, we used the serial-section transmission electron\nmicroscopy (ssTEM) volume of the entire nervous system of a first instar larva as described in\nOhyama et al. (2015). Briefly, a 6-h-old [iso] CantonS G1 x w1118 brain was serially sectioned at 50\nnm and imaged at 4 nm per pixel with an FEI Spirit BioTWIN TEM (Hillsboro). After images process-\ning and compression, the whole dataset was stored on servers accessible by the web page CAT-\nMAID (Collaborative annotation Toolkit for Massive Amounts of Image Data, http://openconnecto.\nme/catmaid/, Saalfeld et al., 2009). The reconstruction was performed manually following the\nmethod used in Ohyama et al. (2015) and described in detail in Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016. All\nphotoreceptor neurons were traced from the Bolwig nerve\u2019s entrance in the ssTEM stack up to their\nterminals within the larval optic neuropil. The loss of eight 50 nm serial sections between frames\n1103 and 1112 have made difficult to get all the neurons complete especially in the right hemi-\nsphere. Therefore, attempts to cross the gap for a neuron were validated with its contralateral\nhomolog. We found 60 neurons in total, measuring 12.5 millimeters of cable and presenting 2090\npresynaptic sites and 4414 postsynaptic sites. seven tiny fragments (that amount to 0.018 millimeters\nof cable and 20 postsynaptic sites in total) could not be attached to full neuronal arbors.

        "full_text": "We characterized neuron types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, as well as \ncross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and \ninterhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending \nneurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain's most recurrent circuits comprised the \ninput and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer \nshortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. The \nidentified brain architecture provides a basis for future experimental and theoretical studies of \nneural circuits.\nIntroduction\nOne of the brain's defining characteristics is its synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome. A \nsynapse-resolution connectome is therefore an essential prerequisite for understanding the \nmechanisms of brain function (1, 2). To date, complete synaptic-resolution connec-tomes \nhave only been mapped for three organisms with up to several hundred brain neurons \n(3\u20135). Reconstructing and proof-reading circuits from larger brains has been extremely \nchallenging. Synapse-resolution circuitry of larger brains has therefore been approached \nonly considering select subregions (6\u20138). However, pervasive interconnectivity has been \nobserved between brain regions (9, 10). Large-scale recording of functional activity in \ninvertebrates (11) and vertebrates (12) demonstrates that neural computations occur across \nspatially dispersed brain regions, highlighting the need for brain-wide circuit studies.\nWe therefore sought to generate a comprehensive synapse-resolution connectivity map of \na relatively complex brain of a small insect that has a rich behavioral repertoire and is \nexperimentally tractable. We settled on the 1st instar larva of Drosophila melanogaster, \nwhich has a compact brain with several thousand neurons that can be imaged at the \nnanometer scale with electron microscopy (EM) and its circuits reconstructed within a \nreasonable time frame. Its brain structures are homologous to those of adult Drosophila \nand larger insects of other species (13\u201315). The 1st instar larva already has as rich a \nrepertoire of adaptive behaviors as the 3rd instar (16\u201318), including short- and long-term \nmemory (13, 19, 20), value computation, and action selection (19, 21\u201323). Furthermore, \nthe circuit architecture is stable throughout larval stages (24). Thus, although neurons grow \nin size to accompany the growth of the body, they maintain the fraction of synapses they \nreceive from specific partners. Finally, an exceptional genetic toolkit and transparent body \nmake the Drosophila larva an excellent model for manipulating and recording activity in \nspecific neurons in freely behaving animals and relating structural motifs to their function \n(19, 21\u201323, 25\u201327). We mapped all neurons of a Drosophila larva brain and annotated \ntheir synapses using computer-assisted reconstruction with CATMAID (see Methods) in a \nnanometer-resolution EM volume of the central nervous system (CNS) (23).\nResults\nReconstruction of the Drosophila larva brain in a full-CNS electron microscopy volume\nWe previously generated a synaptic-resolution EM volume of the CNS of a 1st instar \nDrosophila larva (23, 28). This volume contains all CNS neurons, as well as sensory \nWinding et al.\nPage 2\nScience.

Previous studies have used this EM volume to \nreconstruct most sensory inputs to the brain (455 neurons), their downstream partners, and \nthe higher-order learning center (total 1054 brain neurons). We reconstructed the remaining \n1507 neurons in the brain. The resulting dataset contains 480 input neurons and 2536 \ndifferentiated brain neurons (3016 neurons total), and ~548,000 synaptic sites (Fig. 1, A and \nB, and fig. S1, A to D). Most neurons (>99%) were reconstructed to completion, and the \nmajority of annotated synaptic sites in the brain (75%) were linked with a neuron (Fig. 1B). \nThe remaining 25% were mostly composed of small dendritic fragments, reconstruction of \nwhich is labor-intensive. Moreover, prior studies have shown that neurons make multiple \nconnections with the same partner on different dendritic branches (24, 28), so orphaned \nsynapses may affect synaptic weights of known connections but are unlikely to add entirely \nnew strong connections or change conclusions about strongly connected pathways.\nMost neurons in Drosophila are mirrored across hemispheres, such that each neuron has \na hemilateral homolog in the opposite hemisphere (28). We identified all homologous \nhemilateral partners using automated graph matching (29\u201331) followed by manual review. \nThese pairings were robust across a variety of independent morphological and connectivity \nmetrics (fig. S1, E and F). Our data suggest that 93% of brain neurons have hemilateral \nhomologous partners in the opposite hemisphere (Fig. 1C). Kenyon cells (KC) (176 neurons) \nin the learning and memory center comprise most unpaired neurons (13).\nThese homologous partners were used to identify potential reconstruction errors and \nto target proofreading to such neurons (fig. S1D). To assess the effectiveness of this \ntargeted proofreading, we randomly selected ten brain interneurons and fully proofread \nthem according to previously described methods (23, 28). Most (74%) neuron\u2192neuron \nconnections, or edges, remained unchanged. Edges that did change after proofreading \nmostly displayed a modest increase in synaptic strength, suggesting errors of omission, \nwhich were previously described as the most common type of error (28, 32) (fig. S1, G \nand H). In the following sections, we investigate neuron and connection types, the flow of \ninformation from inputs to outputs, multisensory integration, cross-hemisphere interactions, \nfeedback from outputs to inputs, and the level of recurrence in the brain and brain-nerve \ncord interactions.\nIdentification of all brain input neurons, interneurons, and output neurons\nTo facilitate the analysis of the connectome, we identified a set of broad neuron classes \nbased on prior information. Brain neurons were divided into three general categories: input \nneurons, output neurons, and interneurons (Fig. 1, D and E). Brain input neurons (Fig. 1F) \ncomprise two broad classes: (i) sensory neurons (SNs) with axons in the brain (33\u201335), and \n(ii) ascending neurons (ANs; fig. S2) that transmit somatosensory signals from the ventral \nnerve cord (VNC) (23, 36\u201338). Brain output neurons comprise three broad classes: those \nwith axons terminating in the ring gland (RGNs), descending to the SEZ (DNsSEZ), or \ndescending into the VNC (DNsVNC) (Fig. 1H). The full set of RGNs have been previously \ndescribed (35, 36, 39), whereas DNsSEZ and DNsVNC were reconstructed and identified here \nbased on axon projections (fig. S3).\nWinding et al.\nPage 3\nScience. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 May 16.\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts\n",

        "full_text": "Brain interneurons comprised all neurons with cell bodies and axons and dendrites in the \nbrain. We subdivided interneurons into classes based on previously known functional role or \ndirect connectivity with neurons of known functional role (Fig. 1G and fig. S4). We started \nwith sensory input neurons and identified their projection neurons (PNs) in the primary \nsensory neuropils and the neurons postsynaptic of these PNs in the brain center for encoding \ninnate valences (the lateral horn, LH). We used the previously characterized neurons of \nthe learning center [the mushroom body (MB)], including: the KCs that sparsely represent \nstimulus identities; MB output neurons (MBONs) that represent learned valences of stimuli; \nMB modulatory input neurons (MBINs, mostly dopaminergic, DANs) that provide teaching \nsignals for learning; and their input neurons (MB feedforward neurons, MB-FFN) (19); \nMB feedback neurons (MB-FBNs that connect MBONs and MBINs) (19); and convergence \nneurons (CN) that integrate learned and innate valences from the MB and LH (21). We also \nidentified all presynaptic partners of the three output neuron types.\nIdentification of all axons and dendrites in the brain\nTo better understand neuron morphology, we identified all axons and dendrites. In \nDrosophila, axons and dendrites contain most of a neuron's presynaptic and postsynaptic \nsites, respectively, and are separated by a linker domain devoid of synapses. We used \nan established strategy to identify the synapse-devoid linker domains (see Methods) (28). \nAxonic and dendritic compartments were defined as distal or proximal to these linker \ndomains, respectively. These data were manually proofread, and an axon-dendrite split \npoint was placed for each neuron. We determined that 95.5% of the brain (2421 neurons) \nare polarized with an identifiable axon and dendrite, 0.5% (13 neurons) are unpolarized \nwith no definable axon, and 4.0% (102 neurons) are immature (Fig. 2A). These immature \nneurons were not the developmentally arrested, small undifferentiated (SU) neurons that \nlater differentiate into adult neurons (40) and their nuclei were not heterochromatin-rich like \nthose of SU neurons, despite their general lack of arborization or synaptic sites. It is likely \nthat these immature neurons started to differentiate but were still in the process of neurite \noutgrowth and polarization when the sample was collected. This population includes 78 \nimmature KCs (13) but also 24 non-KC immature neurons, revealing limited neurogenesis of \nlarval neurons outside the memory and learning center.\nAll polarized neurons segregated pre- and post-synaptic sites within axons and dendrites, \nrespectively (Fig. 2B). However, we also found that axons often contained postsynaptic sites \nand dendrites contained presynaptic sites. Thus, neurons can synapse directly onto axons \nand dendrites can directly synapse onto other neurons.\nFour connection types: axo-dendritic, axo-axonic, dendro-axonic and dendro-dendritic\nWhereas axo-dendritic connections are well established in the literature, other nonca-nonical \ninteractions such as axo-axonic connectivity (13, 41\u201344) and dendritic output (13, 45\u201347) \nhave been observed but are not as well studied, and their prevalence was unknown. We \ntherefore identified all axodendritic (a-d), axo-axonic (a-a), dendro-dendritic (d-d), and \ndendro-axonic (d-a) connections in the brain. Most synapses were a-d (66.6%) or a-a \n(25.8%); however, there were still many d-d (5.8%) and d-a synaptic sites (1.8%, Fig. 2C).\nWinding et al.\nPage 4\nScience.

Notably, 95 neurons (3.8%) received especially large amounts of axonic input relative \nto output (fig. S5, A and B), including subsets of KCs, DANs, and predescending neurons \n(pre-DNsVNC). Neurons that make dendritic output onto other neurons were much rarer \n(16.5%), but some made an especially large amount of dendritic output relative to input, \nincluding subsets of KCs and predescending neurons (fig. S5, C and D).\nThe connectome can be thought of as four graphs (Fig. 2D), where all four graphs share \nthe same set of nodes (i.e., neurons), and the four edge types (a-d, a-a, d-d, and d-a) \neach comprise a separate graph. We quantified the number of neurons (nodes), the density, \nand maximum node degree for each graph (Fig. 2E). The axo-dendritic graph had the \nhighest density (i.e., the most connections) and highest number of neurons participating \nin connectivity, whereas the axo-axonic graph had the highest maximum degree (i.e., the \nmaximum number of synaptic partners observed in an individual neuron).\nWe next wondered whether neurons were connected by one or multiple edge types. Most \nneuron partners (95%) were connected in only one way (a-d, a-a, d-d, or d-a). However, \nwe also observed many edges with multiple connection types (fig. S6D), which occurred \nmore often than expected by a null model. The most common examples were a-d combined \nwith a-a, however many combinations were observed, including rare combinations of three-\nor four-edge types between the same neurons. Four-edge connections were mostly found \nin local neurons (LNs, i.e., neurons involved in local processing in a specific neuropil) \nand predescending neurons, whereas three-edge connections were more dispersed amongst \nmultiple cell types, but with a focus in LNs and predescending neurons (fig. S6E).\nNumerically strong connections are reproducible across brain hemispheres\nWe investigated the distribution of edge strengths for each connection type (fig. S6, A and \nB). Most edges were weak (1 or 2 synapses) for all connection types (a-d: 60%, a-a: 75%, \nd-d: 79%, d-a: 91%; 66% across all types). However, strong edges (\u22655 synapse) contained \nthe majority (a-d: 61%; across all types: 55%; fig. S6B), whereas weak edges (1 or 2 \nsynapses) contained the minority (a-d: 22%; across all types: 28%) of synaptic sites.\nWe next investigated edge symmetry across the two brain hemispheres. Edge strength \ncorrelated with interhemispheric symmetry (fig. S6C): weak edges were mostly \nasymmetrical whereas strong edges were highly conserved between hemispheres. With edge \nstrengths of at least 5 and 10 synapses, most edges (>80 and >95%, respectively) were \nsymmetrical across all edge types. Similarly, weak, variable connections were observed in C. \nelegans (48). Given that many weak connections are not reproducible between hemispheres, \nwe cannot discern whether the observed sto-chasticity is due to reconstruction error or \ndevelopmental noise (28). We therefore focus much of our analysis on strong reproducible \nconnections (see Methods). However, weak connections could have notable roles, such \nas maintaining a certain membrane potential (49), adding noise (50) or contributing to \nidiosyncratic variability in behavior.\nWinding et al.\nPage 5\nScience.

We applied the signal flow algorithm (see Methods) to the \ngraph with all edge types combined to sort neurons according to the flow from sensory \nto descending neurons. We used this input-to-output sorting to categorize connections in \nthe brain: we defined connections as feedforward if they projected from neurons closer to \nsensory periphery to neurons closer to descending neurons, and vice versa for feedback \nedges. The a-d graph displayed the most feedforward synapses; a-a and d-d graphs displayed \na mixture of feedforward and feedback, with a bias toward feedforward synapses; whereas \nthe d-a graph displayed the most feedback synapses (Fig. 2F and fig. S6, F and G).\nWe next compared neuron sortings when performed on each of the four graphs \nindependently (Fig. 2G and fig. S7). The sorting of the a-d graph best matched the summed \ngraph (graph with all edge types combined) and sorted the network from sensory periphery \nto brain output neurons. The a-a and a-d graphs displayed a similar flow from sensory to \noutput, despite the details of the sorting being different (Spearman's correlation coefficient \n= 0.44 between the signal flow sorting of the a-a and a-d graphs). Notably, the d-a graph \nsorting tended to be the inverse of the a-d graph's (Spearman's correlation coefficient = \n\u20130.61), i.e., starting at brain output neurons and ending at the sensory periphery. Most d-a \nedges (63%) were the inverse of a-d edges (i.e., there was a high edge reciprocity; Fig. 2H), \nwhich explains the inverse relationship between these graphs.\nA-a and to a lesser extent d-d connections displayed high edge reciprocity, meaning many \nneurons displayed reciprocal a-a connections and d-d connections, respectively (Fig. 2H). \nNote that because all connections are directional, such reciprocal loops were not guaranteed \nto occur.\nHierarchical clustering estimates 93 connectivity-based brain neuron types\nNext, we subdivided brain neurons into types based on their synaptic connectivity. We used \nthe graph structure of all four connection types to spectrally embed all brain neurons in a \nshared space and clustered them using this representation (see Methods). This resulted in \nnested sets of clusters that can be examined at a desired granularity, from large groups of \nneurons to 93 fine-grained cell types (Fig. 3A and fig. S8, A to D). In contrast with results \nfrom community detection algorithms, our clusters are not necessarily composed of groups \nof neurons which communicate more densely within a cluster (see Methods). Instead, our \nclustering grouped neurons with similar connectivity to other neurons even if little direct \nintracluster connectivity was present\u2014for example, olfactory PNs from the antennal lobe \nwhich function as parallel input channels and whose activity is regulated as a group (33). \nThus, our approach is better suited to finding neuron types, rather than densely connected \nprocessing modules. Our connectivity-based clusters were internally consistent for attributes \nbesides connectivity. The morphology of neurons within clusters was similar, with the mean \nwithin-cluster NBLAST score (0.80 \u00b1 0.15 SD) much higher than expected by chance (0.5), \neven though clustering was based solely on connectivity and no morphological data were \nused (Fig. 3B and fig.

S8, D to G).\nThe connectivity within and between all clusters is displayed in Fig. 3C. Many (but \nnot all) clusters displayed strong intracluster connectivity and shared output to similar \npostsynaptic clusters. A coarser granularity can also be selected (Fig. 3D) and used to \nexplore connectivity between larger groups of related neuron types.\nMost brain hubs are pre- or postsynaptic to the learning center\nHubs play key roles in brain computations and behavior (51). We therefore identified \nbrain hubs for all connection types. To focus on the strongest hubs, reproducible across \nhemispheres, we filtered the connectome to include only strong connections observed in \nboth hemispheres (using a \u22651% input threshold; see Methods). Brain hubs were defined \nas having \u226520 pre- or postsynaptic partners, respectively, i.e., an in- or out-degree of \u226520 \n[this threshold is based on the a-d network mean plus 1.5 standard deviations (SD)]. We \ndistinguished between in-hubs (over the in-degree threshold), out-hubs (over the out-degree \nthreshold), and in-out hubs (over both thresholds). Using these criteria, we identified 506 \na-d, 100 a-a, 10 d-d, and 8 d-a hubs (Fig. 3E and fig. S9). a-d out-hubs were often observed \nin clusters closer to the sensory periphery, notably PNs, whereas a-d in-hubs were more \noften closer to output clusters, including pre-output and output neurons. Most (73%, 19 \nof 26 pairs) of a-d in-out hubs were postsynaptic to the learning center output neurons \n(MBONs) and/or presynaptic to its modulatory neurons that drive learning (MBONs, CNs, \nMB-FBNs, MB-FFNs, and one pre-DNVNC pair postsynaptic to MBONs; Fig. 3F). Several \nin-out hubs (23%, 12 pairs) were convergence neurons (CNs), receiving input from both the \nMB and LH, which encode learned and innate values, respectively (19, 21). One such in-out \nhub is the CN-MBON-m1, shown to functionally integrate learned and innate values and \nbidirectionally control approach and avoidance (21).\nIdentification of all brain local neurons\nBrain neurons are often divided into local neurons (LNs), involved in local processing within \na specific brain neuropil or layer, and PNs, which carry information to other brain regions. \nTo systematically identify all brain LNs, we developed two connectivity-based definitions \n(fig. S10, A and B). Type 1 LNs provide most of their output to neurons in their sensory \nlayer (defined by the number of hops from SNs of a particular modality), and/or to the \nsensory layer directly upstream of them (fig. S10A). Type 2 LNs received most of their input \nand sent most of their output to any sensory layer, to which it did not belong (fig. S10B). \nIn this way, we identified all previously published LNs (13, 33, 34) and many new putative \nLNs (fig. S10, C and D). We then defined all 2nd order PNs by exclusion, i.e., all neurons \nthat were not local but were directly downstream of SNs (fig. S10E). Non-LN neurons that \nare higher order (i.e., not directly downstream of SNs) are usually termed output neurons \nfrom a specific neuropile (13, 52, 53) rather than PNs, but we refrain from labeling them \nin a specific way and leave them undefined as non-LNs.

S10G), \nperhaps allowing LNs to regulate multiple aspects of activity in both the axon and dendrite.\nMost of the LNs (98 neurons) that met the above definition were either 2nd order neurons \ndirectly downstream of SNs (i.e., one hop from SNs) or 3rd order neurons (two hops \ndownstream of SNs; fig. S10C). A very small number of 4th-order LNs were also identified \n(6 neurons; fig. S10, C and D). Two of the three pairs were pre-DNVNC neurons and one was \ndownstream of neurons that integrate learned and innate valence, suggesting some level of \nlocal processing in the pre-DNVNC and post-MB flayers. Overall, progressively fewer LNs \nwere found further from the sensory periphery.\nIdentification of all brain sensory pathways\nWe systematically characterized brainwide pathways from distinct types of SNs to all \nother brain neurons. For the remainder of the paper, we will focus our analysis on a-d \nconnections because they are the most abundant and best understood in terms of functional \neffects. We generated all possible a-d pathways from brain input neurons to all other \nbrain neurons and ending at output neurons in fewer than 6 hops (Fig. 3G). We classified \ninput neurons based on their known sensory modalities. Olfactory (33), gustatory (35), \nthermosensory (54), visual (34), gut (35), and respiratory state SNs (55) project directly to \nthe brain. Somatosensory ANs from the nerve cord received direct or indirect input from \nmechanosensory (22, 23), nociceptive (23, 56), and proprioceptive SNs (28) (fig. S2 and \ntable S1) and their axons projected to the brain.\nWe identified all 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-order brain neurons downstream of each input \nmodality (Fig. 4, A to C). For the purpose of this analysis, we defined the order of a neuron \naccording to its lowest order input from any input neuron type. However, neurons can \nreceive multipath input from the same input neuron type, through distinct paths of different \nlengths (e.g., they can be both 2nd-and 3rd-order). Many brain neurons (545; 21%) were \n2nd order, but most (1410; 56%) were 3rd order (received input from a SN in two hops). A \nconsiderable number were 4th order (377; 15%), but only 16 neurons (<1%) were 5th order \n(Fig. 4C). Note that 188 brain neurons (7%) were either immature or received only input \nfrom neurons in the SEZ of unknown modality and were therefore not categorized. Of the \nneurons analyzed, no brain neuron was more than 4 hops removed from at least one input \nneuron and most were only 2 or 3 hops removed.\nMost 2nd-order neurons received direct input from a single SN type (Fig. 4B), with some \nexceptions, including olfactory local neurons that also received input from gustatory and \nthermowarm SNs (33, 54). 3rd-order neurons were more often shared across modalities and \nby the 4th order, most neurons were shared across modalities (Fig. 4B). However, even \nneurons that are exclusively 2nd or 3rd order for one modality can receive input from other \nmodalities through longer paths.\nMost sensory modalities exhibited a large expansion of neuron numbers in the 3rd order, \ncompared with 2nd-order layers (Fig. 4A and table S2), indicating prominent divergence, \ni.e., they broadcast their signals to many different downstream partners. Generally, the \nnumber of neurons downstream of 2nd-order PNs (divergence) was higher than the number \nWinding et al.\nPage 8\nScience.

Convergence was also prominent, \nwith most 3rd-order neurons receiving input from multiple 2nd-order PNs.\nSensory information can reach output neurons within one to three hops\nWe investigated the cell type identities of neurons at different processing layers, i.e., at \ndifferent hops from SNs or ANs (2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-and 5th-order neurons) within each sensory \ncircuit (Fig. 4C). Sensory information reached all cell classes within a couple hops. A \nnotable percentage of brain output neurons were 2nd order, i.e., postsynaptic (one hop) of \nSNs or ANs (DNsVNC: 13%, DNsSEZ: 53%, RGNs: 46%), or 3rd order, i.e., two hops from \nSNs or ANs (DNsVNC: 52%, DNsSEZ: 38%, RGNs: 29%). The remaining 34% of DNsVNC, \n5% of DNsSEZ, and 21% of RGNs were 4th order (three hops from SNs/ANs, Fig. 4C). \nThus, most output neurons receive sensory information within a maximum of three hops. \nHowever, although these direct (one-hop), two-hop, or three-hop connections represent the \nshortest paths to output neurons, most output neurons also received longer multihop input \nfrom SNs.\nThe highest order neurons in the brain (5th order) were not output neurons, but contained 14 \npre-output neurons, presynaptic to DNsVNC. These neurons received input from and output \nto other pre-DNsVNC (the most numerous group of 4th-order neurons) and shared some \nupstream and downstream partners, suggesting complex, multilayered connectivity between \npre-DNsVNC (fig. S11). This suggests that, even though DNVNC neurons can receive sensory \ninput in very few hops, they also receive the most processed information in the brain through \nlonger paths. We observed multiple parallel pathways from each sensory modality to DNs \n(fig. S12, A and B). However, we also found extensive connectivity between neurons within \nthese parallel pathways, suggesting they likely form a distributed processing network (fig. \nS12C). Most pathways and most individual neurons within paths were not restricted to a \nparticular sensory modality and were instead shared by multiple modalities (fig. S12, D and \nE).\nDifferent sensory modalities targeted different types of output neurons (Fig. 4C). For \nexample, gustatory and gut sensory signals targeted more DNsSEZ than DNsVNC, whereas \nother modalities targeted more DNsVNC than DNsSEZ. Generally, sensory pathways to \nDNsSEZ were shorter compared with pathways to DNsVNC. Most DNsSEZ were 2nd order \n(receiving direct inputs from SNs) whereas most DNsVNC were 3rd order.\nOutput neurons receive input from the same modality through multiple paths of varying \nlengths\nSensory information is processed both serially and in parallel (57) but the architecture \nof sensory circuits is not fully understood. While characterizing the shortest paths from \nSNs to output neurons, we observed that output neurons also receive sensory information \nthrough longer paths. The additional hops in longer paths likely result in further processing \nof the stimulus, which may be important to extract more abstract features (58, 59) or to \nlayer more complex computations on top of existing ones (60). To provide a basis for a \ncomprehensive understanding of sensory processing circuits, we therefore systematically \nanalyzed all pathways and not just the shortest ones.\nWinding et al.\nPage 9\nScience.

        "full_text": "We developed a computational tool, the signal cascade, that propagates polysynaptic signals \nthrough the brain based on the assumption that the likelihood of signal propagation between \ntwo connected neurons depends on the number of synapses between them (Fig. 4D; see \nMethods). Synapse counts can be used to accurately predict synaptic surface area and \nare therefore a good proxy for synaptic strength (61). This tool therefore captures all \npolysynaptic pathways with reasonably strong connections along their length. The algorithm \nmakes no assumption about the sign of connections and assumes that both excitatory and \ninhibitory connections can influence the activity of downstream neurons relative to baseline \nactivity. In support of this assumption, patch-clamp recordings show that larval neurons \nhave baseline activity that can be bidirectionally modified (19, 22) and direct optogenetic \ninhibition; further, activation of neurons relative to their own baseline can promote opposite \nactions (21).\nSignals can be started and terminated at predefined neurons to explore all pathways that link \nthem. We use brain output neurons as end points unless otherwise mentioned. In cascades \nstarted at SNs, the signal generally reached DNsVNC in 3 to 6 hops and rarely more than \n8 hops (Fig. 4E), which we therefore considered the maximum depth of the brain. 5-hop \npathways were shown to be functional in the larva (specifically, MD class IV neurons to \nMB DANs) (19), but no studies have yet functionally tested 6-, 7-, or 8-hop pathways. We \ntherefore stop the cascades at either 8 or 5 hops, using 8 hops to not miss long paths and \n5 hops to determine which aspects of architecture are apparent with a pathway length for \nwhich functional connectivity has been confirmed.\nUsing 8-hop cascades, we identified all pathways between SNs or ANs and output neurons \n(Fig. 4E). Individual sensory modalities had different median pathway depths to output \nneurons (fig. S13A). Overall, olfaction and gustation displayed the shortest pathways to \noutput neurons, whereas the ascending somatosensory modalities displayed the longest.\nOutput neurons received sensory inputs from the same modality through multiple paths \nof different lengths. For example, some paths from the same sensory modality reached \nDNsVNC in 2 hops, whereas others displayed as many as 6 hops (fig. S13A). DNsVNC, on \naverage, received input from pathways of three different lengths from individual sensory \nmodalities (Fig. 4F and fig. S13B).\nMost brain neurons are multimodal\nWe next investigated the multimodal character of the brain as a whole, while taking into \naccount the longer pathways. We started 8-hop signal cascades from each sensory modality \nand reported the combinations of sensory input each neuron received (fig. S13, C and D). \nVery few neurons (12 or 14% with 8- or 5-hop cascades, respectively) received signals from \nonly one modality, purported labeled line neurons, whereas most neurons were multimodal \n(Fig. 4G), including brain output neurons (fig. S13, E and F). Most labeled line neurons \nwere close to the sensory periphery (Fig. 4H). Nevertheless, many modalities converged \nalready at the earliest stages of sensory processing, with only 36 or 38% (with 8- and \n5-hop cascades) of 2nd-order PNs/PNssomato being unimodal (fig.

DANs have been implicated in \nlearning, motivation, and action-selection across the animal kingdom (62) and understanding \nthe type of sensory information they receive is essential for understanding their function. \nDANs receive input from sensory systems that sense rewards and punishments (19, 63), but \nthe extent to which they receive input from other modalities was unclear. We found that \nDANs received input from all sensory modalities, including from those that normally sense \nconditioned stimuli in learning tasks (e.g., olfactory) and from proprioceptive neurons (with \n5- or 8-hop cascades; Fig. 4I). By contrast, other MB modulatory neurons (13) were not \nas integrative: only 33% (with 5- or 8-hop cascades) of octopaminergic neurons (OANs) \nreceived input from all modalities.\nIdentification of all ipsilateral, bilateral, and contralateral neurons\nThe presence of two hemispheres is a fundamental property of the brain, but the way in \nwhich information from both hemispheres is integrated and used in neural computation is \nnot well understood. To investigate the structural basis of interhemispheric interactions, we \nidentified all neurons that engaged in interhemispheric communication through contralateral \nprojections (axonal or dendritic, Fig. 5, A and B). Most (98%) of neurons displayed \nipsilateral dendrites (fig. S14). A small population of neurons (1%) had bilateral dendrites \nwith either ipsilateral, bilateral, or contralateral axons. These neurons were only observed \nin the learning center (MBONs) and brain output network (pre-DNsVNC, DNsVNC, DNsSEZ) \n(fig. S15). Although most neurons had ipsilateral (61%) a substantial number had bilateral \n(24%) or contralateral (15%) axons (Fig. 5C). Notably, 88% of a-d in-out hubs had either \ncontra- or bilateral axons, even though these neurons account for only 39% of brain neurons.\nSome neurons with bilateral axons target distinct partners in the two hemispheres\nNeurons with bilateral axons project to both hemispheres, but do they communicate \nwith homologous postsynaptic partners in both hemispheres? We calculated the cosine \nsimilarity between postsynaptic partners of individual bilaterally projecting neurons in the \ntwo hemispheres (Fig. 5D, left). Most bilateral neurons generally connected to homologous \npartners in both hemispheres, i.e., had high partner similarity scores, but there were some \nneurons that had low scores. We binned these neurons into three categories based on their \npartner similarity scores and analyzed their partners further (Fig. 5D, right; fig. S16).\nWe found 7 pairs of bilateral neurons with completely different postsynaptic partners on \nthe ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres and 13 pairs with mostly non-overlapping ipsi- \nand contralateral partners (fig. S16). All of these neurons had unilateral dendrites. Most \nasymmetric bilateral neurons synapsed onto pre-DNs or DNs in one hemisphere but not the \nother, or onto different DNs or pre-DNs in the two hemispheres. These neurons could be \ninvolved in controlling asymmetric motor patterns that require activation of different subsets \nof muscles on the left and right sides of the body. Indeed, some DNs that receive input from \nasymmetric bilateral neurons (fig.

        "full_text": "Reciprocal contralateral loops\nTo better understand information flow between brain hemispheres, we asked how ipsilateral, \nbilateral, and contralateral neurons communicate with each other and calculated their \nconnection probability (Fig. 5E). Ipsilateral neurons synapsed approximately equally onto \nipsilateral, bilateral, and contralateral neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Bilateral \nneurons had a slight preference for bilateral and contralateral neurons. Contralateral neurons \ndisplayed a notable preference for other contralateral neurons, both in terms of input and \noutput. Individual contralateral neurons synapsed onto 3.4 other contralateral neurons on \naverage (34% of their downstream partners), whereas ipsilateral neurons synapsed onto 1.5 \ncontralateral neurons on average (15% of their downstream partners).\nBecause each contralateral neuron has a homolog in the opposite hemisphere, we wondered \nwhether homologous left-right contralateral neuron pairs tended to directly synapse onto \neach other. We found that the connection probability onto a homologous contralateral \npartner was much higher than onto a nonhomologous neuron (Fig. 5F). We identified 24 \nreciprocally connected homologous pairs (10% of contralateral neurons; fig. S17). Most \nwere either pre-DNsVNC, DNsVNC, postsynaptic of the learning center outputs (MBONs), \nand/or provided feedback onto the MB DANs (figs. S17D and S18). Many homologous pair \nloops interacted amongst themselves, forming double or super loops (fig. S18B). Double \nand super loops occurred between neuron pairs with similar morphology and/or connectivity. \nOne super loop involved four neuron pairs downstream of the in-out hub, MBON-m1, which \nintegrates input from other MBONs and from the LH (21) and computes predicted values \nof stimuli. This super loop projected onto pre-DNsVNC and indirectly sent feedback onto \nMB DANs through MB-FBNs (fig. S18C). The other super loop involved five neurons \nthat projected onto DNsVNC. Thus, the reciprocal pair loops, double loops, and super \nloops appear to be prevalent in brain areas that potentially play a role in action-selection \n(downstream of MBONs and upstream of DNsVNC) and learning (upstream of MB DANs).\nInterhemispheric integration occurs across most of the brain\nOur finding that 39% of brain neurons have contra- or bilateral axons suggests that the \ntwo hemispheres are heavily interconnected and that their information could be integrated \nat many sites. To systematically investigate where interhemispheric convergence occurs, we \ngenerated signal cascades from either left-or right-side SNs and observed the resulting signal \npropagation through both hemispheres (fig. S19, A to C). Signals crossed to the opposite \nhemisphere within 2 hops and were robustly found in both hemispheres by 3 hops (fig. \nS19A). We assessed simultaneous overlap between left- and right-side sensory signals to \nfind interhemispheric integration sites. The cell types of all integrative ipsilateral, bilateral, \nand contralateral types were identified (fig. S19B). We quantified the lateralization of each \nneuron by the ratio of left and right signals they received through signal cascades. Most \nneurons (81 or 79%, using 8- or 5-hop cascades) integrated signals from both left and right \nSNs (fig. S19C). Most lateralized neurons were PNs, KCs, and DNsSEZ (Fig. 5G). Thus, \nafter integration of contralateral- and ipsilateral information on one side of the brain, the \nintegrated information is often passed back to the other hemisphere (fig.

However, \nrecurrence is an important feature of brain circuits (19, 65) and can improve computational \npower in artificial neural nets (66). We therefore characterized the reverse signal in the a-d \nnetwork, from output neurons back toward the sensory periphery. We generated independent \nsignal cascades starting at each level-7 brain cluster (Figs. 6A and 3A). Because these \nclusters were sorted from brain inputs to outputs, we could track the extent to which signals \npropagated up or down this brain structure to other clusters. We kept these cascades short \n(ending after 2 hops) to initially limit our analysis to the shorter paths of reverse signal \nand identify its lower bound. A cascade signal that traveled up the brain cluster structure \ntoward the sensory periphery was considered backward, whereas a signal that traveled down \nthe cluster structure toward the output neurons was considered forward. Robust forward and \nbackward signal originated from nearly all brain clusters (Fig. 6B). Deeper brain clusters \n(closer to brain outputs) received mostly forward signals, whereas shallower clusters (closer \nto sensory periphery) received a mixture of forward and backward signals. Most brain \nclusters provided forward and backward signals to multiple other clusters simultaneously; \nthis was observed even for single neurons within each cluster (Fig. 6C).\nWe wondered to what extent individual neurons provide feedback to their own upstream \npartners, thereby forming recurrent loops. We therefore used multihop signal cascades from \nindividual neurons to identify their direct and indirect downstream partners throughout \nthe brain (up to 5 hops). We then determined which of these downstream partners sent \nrecurrent signals back to the source neuron. We found that 41% of brain neurons were \nrecurrent, i.e., sent signals back to at least one of their upstream partners (Fig. 6D). \nFurthermore, downstream neurons often sent recurrent signals to upstream neurons using \npaths of multiple different lengths (Fig. 6E). On average, recurrent communication between \na single downstream neuron and its upstream partner used polysynaptic paths of multiple \ndifferent lengths (on average 1.9 \u00b1 0.9 SD).\nInput and output neurons of the learning center are among the most recurrent in the brain\nWe next analyzed which brain cell classes were the most recurrent (Fig. 6F). We define \nrecurrence for individual neurons as the fraction of their polysynaptic downstream partners \n(using cascades of up to 5 hops) that sent signal back to that source neuron (also using 5-hop \ncascades) with a-d connections. Therefore, neurons with high and low recurrence scores are \nengaged in many and few recurrent loops, respectively.\nThe fraction of recurrent partners varied widely between distinct neuron classes (Fig. 6F). \nPNs and the intrinsic neurons of the learning center (KCs) had virtually no recurrent partners \n(on average, 1.2% and 0.1%, respectively). Other neurons associated with the learning \ncenter were amongst the most recurrent in the brain: DANs (57%), the modulatory neurons \nthat drive learning; MB-FBNs (51%), presynaptic to DANs and implicated in computing \npredicted value and regulating learning (19); MBONs (45%), the outputs of the learning \ncenter and presynaptic to MB-FBNs; and CNs (42%), presynaptic to both MBONs and \nLHNs, which integrate learned and innate signals (21) (Fig. 6F).

The axons of some DNsVNC (37%) \nand most DNsSEZ (66%) synapsed onto other brain neurons before descending to the \nVNC and SEZ, thus providing putative efference copy signals (i.e., copies of motor \ncommands). Single DNs broadcasted signals to neurons that were directly or indirectly \nupstream of themselves (feedback signals) or onto parallel pathways, namely neurons \nupstream of other output neurons (parallel efference copy signals; Fig. 6H). DNs synapsed \nonto many different brain neurons (Fig. 6H), including 130 postsynaptic partners and 588 \npartners 2 hops downstream of DNsVNC and 320 postsynaptic partners and 1284 partners \n2 hops downstream of DNsSEZ. Of those DNs that synapsed onto brain neurons, we found \nthat individual DNsVNC synapsed on average onto 6 postsynaptic neurons and indirectly \n(through 2 hops) onto 43 neurons. Individual DNsSEZ synapsed on average onto 8 neurons \ndirectly and onto 79 neurons in 2 hops.\nWe investigated the cell type identities of brain neurons receiving DNSEZ and DNVNC \ninput (Fig. 6H). The most prominent DNSEZ targets were PNs [including direct connections \nto an olfactory uniglomerular PN (uPN 67b), 5 pairs of multi-glomerular PNs, 24 pairs \nof gustatory PNs] and pre-DNVNC neurons. The most prominent DNsVNC targets were \npre-DNVNC neurons and MB-related neurons thought to play a role in memory-based action \nselection (CNs) (21) and in driving learning: MBINs (mostly dopaminergic, DANs) and \nFBNs that integrate MBON input and feed it back onto the MBINs (19) (Fig. 6H). DNsVNC \nalso synapsed onto a few PNs (2 nociceptive and 2 gut/mechanosensory PN pairs) and 4 \npairs of MB-FFNs (which carry sensory signals to DANs and OANs) (Fig. 6H).\nSignal cascades revealed that all DANs and most of their upstream MB-FBNs (90%) receive \nfeedback signals from DNsVNC (fig. S20, A to D), forming larger recurrent loops. DANs \neven received direct or 2-hop input from DNsVNC. DNsVNC also sent robust feedback to \nMB-FBNs, that are presynaptic to MBINs/DANs (fig. S20C).\nBrain-nerve cord projectome provides a basis for studying how the brain controls actions\nOur EM volume contains the complete CNS (brain, SEZ, and nerve cord), allowing us to \nassess communication between the brain and the rest of the CNS. Because most motor \nneurons (MNs) are located in the VNC, understanding brain-nerve cord communication is \nessential to understanding how behavior is generated. We reconstructed axons of brain DNs \nthat send feedforward signals outside of the brain. We divided the CNS into 13 regions \nbased on stereotyped landmarks, including all VNC segments, and determined how many \nDN presynaptic sites were located in each CNS region (Fig. 7A-i, fig. S21). This resulted \nin a brain-VNC projectome directly linked to the connectome. Each VNC segment contains \nMNs, which innervate muscles in stereotyped positions throughout the body (Fig. 7A-ii). \nPrevious studies have identified body segments involved in specific behaviors (Fig. 7A-iii), \nWinding et al.\nPage 14\nScience.

We annotated the projectome plot with candidate behaviors that each DNVNC might \nproduce (Fig. 7B-ii). We found a strong correlation (Cramer's V Correlation Coefficient = \n0.58) between the cluster identity (based on brain connectivity) and nerve cord projection \nregion for the descending neurons (Fig. 7B-iv), indicating that neurons that project to \ndistinct nerve cord regions and likely mediate distinct behaviors also receive distinct patterns \nof brain input (fig.

We quantified the number of hops upstream \nof MNs (for motor layering, Fig. 7E) or downstream of SNs (for sensory layering) each \nA1 interneuron (Fig. 7F).

We also asked whether DNVNC targeted A1 hub \nneurons (with \u226510 up-or downstream partners based on A1 network mean + 1.5 SD). Indeed, \nDNVNC targeted two hubs, namely neurons A03o (in-hub) and A18b (out-hub).\nSome descending neurons modulate sensory processing in the nerve cord\nThe depth of sensory circuits was varied from 3 hops (proprioceptive) to 7 or 8 hops \n(nociceptive and chordotonals) from SNs within A1 (Fig. 7F). DNsVNC mostly targeted \n3rd or 4th-order SNs (2 or 3 hops downstream of SNs), many of which were also \npre- or prepremotor neurons (31 and 39%, respectively). A notable exception were the \nproprioceptive circuits. DNsVNC synapsed onto several 2nd-order proprioceptive neurons \n(Fig. 7F), half of which were also pre- or prepremotor neurons.\nWe categorized DNsVNC into three types based on their direct targets (fig. S23, A to C). \nGroup 1 (20 neurons, 47.6%) targeted both premotor and 2nd-order SNs. Group 2 (10 DNs, \n23.8%) targeted 8 A1 motor circuit neurons (4 pairs) that were not part of sensory circuits \nand had axonal outputs mostly restricted to T3-A1 (fig. S23D). Group 3 (12 DNs, 28.6%) \ntargeted 12 2nd- or 3rd-order A1 SNs (6 pairs) that were not part of A1 motor circuits, \nincluding ANs (2 pairs) and long-range A1 neurons that output collectively to all thoracic \nsegments and most abdominal segments (fig.

These results suggest that DNVNC \nmodulation of post-sensory cells is propagated across the CNS, including back to the brain \nthrough ANs, within A1 itself, and across nearly all VNC segments (T1 to T3, A2 to A7).\nDirect descending-ascending connectivity reveals novel brain-nerve cord zigzag motifs\nTo better understand reciprocal brain-nerve cord communication, we analyzed neurons \nupstream and downstream of A1 ANs. We observed many instances of direct DNVNC\u2192AN \nand AN\u2192DNVNC and AN\u2192DNSEZ connectivity (but no AN\u2192RGN; Fig. 7G and fig. \nS24A). Specifically, 12 DNsVNC-A1 (30%) synapsed onto 4 ANs in A1 (11%), whereas \n24 ANs in A1 (57%) synapsed onto 22 DNsVNC (12%) and 12 DNsSEZ (7%) in the brain. \nTo test whether AN-DN and DN-AN connections were a general feature present in other \nsegments, we assayed connectivity between DNsVNC and all currently reconstructed ANs \nfrom all VNC segments. Individual DNsVNC received 3.6% (\u00b1 5.2% SD) of their input from \nANs, with some receiving >20% of their input from ANs (to a maximum of 37%). It should \nbe noted that this is an underestimate because most ANs from segments other than A1 have \nnot yet been reconstructed. Conversely, individual ANs across the VNC received 3.1% (\u00b1 \n6.1% SD) input from DNsVNC, with some receiving >20% of their input from descending \nneurons (to a maximum of 32%).\nReciprocal loops between DNsVNC and ANs were never observed. Instead, we found zigzag \nmotifs, DNVNC\u2192AN\u2192DNVNC, with different DNsVNC on each side (Fig. 7, H and I). \nSimilar motifs were observed involving DNsSEZ (fig. S24, B and C). To obtain further \ninsight into zigzag motifs, we analyzed the sensory information carried by the A1 ANs \nand the behavioral roles of DNs that participate in these motifs.

We know the behavioral roles of a small \nfraction of DNsVNC (because the driver lines for most have not yet been generated) but we \nfound one motif with known roles for both DNs (Fig. 7J). This motif contained PDM-DN \n(DN1\nVNC) and the MDNs (DN2\nVNC), which promote stop (74) and backup (15), respectively. \nStop-backup is a common behavioral sequence (75), raising the possibility that ANs in \nzigzag motifs could facilitate transitions between actions in a sequence, based on both brain \ninputs and proprioceptive feedback or somatosensory context.\nDiscussion\nWe present a synaptic-resolution connectivity map of an entire Drosophila larva brain and \na detailed analysis of the associated brain circuit architecture. Each neuron was split into \ntwo compartments, axon and dendrite, resulting in a rich multiplexed network with four \nconnection types, facilitating analysis. To characterize long-range brainwide anatomical \npathways, we developed an algorithm that utilizes synapse numbers between neurons to \ntrack signal propagation across polysynaptic pathways.\nConnectivity-based clustering reveals 93 distinct types of brain neurons\nNeuron types have been classified based on their functional role (19, 21, 76), morphology \n(32, 77), gene expression (78), or combinations of features (79, 80). Although these \nfeatures are likely correlated, it is still unclear which is ideal for defining neuron types \nand how neuron types based on different features correspond to each other. We performed \nan unbiased hierarchical clustering of all neurons using synaptic connectivity alone and \nidentified 93 types. The morphology of neurons within clusters was notably similar. \nFurthermore, neurons that had similar known functions were usually found in the same \nor related clusters. Thus, clustering neurons based on synaptic connectivity resulted in \nclusters that were internally consistent for other features, when those features were known. \nHowever, many clusters contained uncharacterized neurons with unknown gene expression \nand function.\nNoncanonical connection types are pronounced in learning and action-selection circuits\nAlthough most connections in the brain were a-d (66.4%), we found a significant number of \na-a (26.4%), d-d (5.4%), and d-a (1.8%) connections. Most neurons that received prominent \naxonic input were in the learning center: DANs that provide the teaching signals for learning \nand KCs that encode stimuli. Modulatory a-a DAN-to-KC input drives heterosynaptic \nplasticity of the KC-to-MBON synapse (81). DANs also receive excitatory a-a input \nfrom KCs, which provides positive feedback that facilitates memory formation (41). KCs \nalso receive a-a input from other KCs. In the adult Drosophila, a-a connections between \notherwise excitatory (cholinergic) KCs were found to be inhibitory due to expression of \ninhibitory mAChR-B in axon terminals (82). Lateral inhibition between KCs could improve \nstimulus discrimination and reduce memory generalization (13). A subset of pre-DNsVNC \nand a few somatosensory PNs, LHNs, and MBONs, and FBNs also had a high axonic input/\noutput ratio. If a-a connections in these neurons are inhibitory they could enhance contrast \nbetween representations of distinct stimuli and actions (57).\nWinding et al.\nPage 17\nScience.

This architecture \nsuggests that distinct features may not be processed independently but rather that each \nfeature may potentially influence the computation of many other features in a distributed \nnetwork. Such architecture has the potential to generate a diversity of neural responses with \nmixed selectivity for specific combinations of features thereby expanding the dimensionality \nof neural representations and increasing output flexibility (84).\nWe found that the shortest paths from sensory neurons to output neurons are surprisingly \nshallow. All output neurons receive input from sensory neurons within a maximum of 3 \nhops. However, most output neurons also received input from the same modality through \nmultiple longer pathways. Such an architecture, with connections that skip layers, is \ncharacteristic of prominent machine learning networks (85, 86), including deep residual \nlearning and U-Net architectures. Although predictive accuracy improves with depth, \nfeatures can become too abstract at deep layers leading to performance degradation (87). \nShortcuts between layers can solve this problem by combining lower-level features as an \nadditional teaching signal (85, 88). Shallower networks with shortcuts can therefore exceed \nthe performance of deeper networks lacking shortcuts (85). The layer skipping we observed \nmay therefore increase the brain's computational capacity, overcoming physiological \nconstraints on the number of neurons that limit network depth.\nRecurrent architecture of the brain with multiple nested loops\nRecurrence has been observed in many brain circuits and implicated in a range of \ncomputations (65, 89\u201392). However, the architecture of long-range recurrent pathways and \nthe nature of the feedback that each neuron receives is still poorly understood. We used \nsignal cascades to systematically identify all connected pairs of brain neurons (with up to 5 \nhops) that had a reciprocal connection (of up to 5 hops). We found that 41% of brain neurons \nreceived long-range recurrent input (up to 5 hops) from at least one of their downstream \npartners with recurrent pathways of varying lengths forming multiple nested loops.\nRecurrent nested structure can compensate for a lack of network depth in artificial neural \nnetworks (66) and supports arbitrary, taskdependent computation depth (93).\nLearning center dopaminergic neurons are amongst the most recurrent in the brain\nDANs were amongst the most recurrent neurons in the brain. Dopaminergic neurons, \nreferred to as DANs in insects, are central for learning, motivation, and action across \nthe animal kingdom (62) and are implicated in a range of human mental disorders (94). \nThe highly recurrent connectivity of DANs might deliver high-dimensional feedback (95), \nWinding et al.\nPage 18\nScience.

We find that DANs also receive long-range \nfeedback (up to 5 hops) from descending neurons, which likely encode motor commands. \nFurthermore, we found that DANs receive polysynaptic feedforward inputs from all sensory \nmodalities. DAN activity correlates with movement in both vertebrates and flies (99), which \ncould be explained by the observed input from DNsVNC or from proprioceptive neurons.\nMost brain hubs are directly downstream or upstream of the learning center\nHub neurons have been shown to play essential roles in behavior (51, 100). We found \nthat most (73%) of the larval brain's in-out hubs were postsynaptic to the learning center \noutput neurons (MBONs) and/or presynaptic to the learning center modulatory neurons \n(mostly DANs). Many were also postsynaptic to the LH that mediates innate behaviors, thus \nintegrating learned and innate values (21). One of these hubs, MBON-m1, has been shown \nto compute overall predicted value by comparing input from neurons encoding positive \nand negative values (21). MBON-m1 bidirectionally promotes approach or avoidance when \nits activity is increased or decreased, respectively. Several additional hubs identified here \nhave similar patterns of input to MBON-m1, suggesting that they may play similar roles in \ncomputing predicted values. These hubs provide direct feedback to the MB DANs and could \ntherefore play roles in regulating learning.\nCross-hemisphere interactions\nWe identified all contralaterally projecting neurons and their connections, providing a basis \nfor understanding how information from both hemispheres is used by the brain. Notably, \nneurons with contralateral axons were disproportionately represented amongst in-out hubs, \nsuggesting that they have important roles in behavior. Contralateral neurons tended to \nsynapse onto each other. Thus, after integration of contra- and ipsilateral information in \none hemisphere, the integrated information is often passed back to the other hemisphere. \nMultiple consecutive hemisphere crossings could potentially enable better discrimination \nbetween ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral events and better coordination between the \ntwo hemispheres. We also discovered multiple reciprocal pair loops between contralateral \nleft-right homologs. If inhibitory, pair loops could mediate interhemispheric comparisons, \nand if excitatory, they could be involved in signal perpetuation or short-term memory (96, \n97). Consistent with this idea, many pair loops occurred between neurons presynaptic to the \nMB DANs.\nBrain and nerve cord interactions\nOur study sheds light on brain-nerve cord interactions. DNs targeted only a small fraction \nof premotor elements that could play important roles in switching between locomotor \nstates. A subset of DNs targeted low-order post-sensory interneurons likely modulating \nsensory processing. DNs and ANs also synapsed onto each other, often forming zigzag \nmotifs (DN1\u2192AN\u2192DN2). A recent study has demonstrated that an AN can activate \nthe downstream DN and drive the same action as the DN (101). Thus, ANs may \nWinding et al.\nPage 19\nScience.

Somatosensory neurons have been shown to activate descending \nneurons in vertebrates (102, 103), raising the possibility that ascending-descending \nconnectivity may be a general feature of brain-nerve cord interactions.\nMaterials and Methods\nElectron Microscopy Data and Reconstruction\nThe EM volume of the central nervous system (CNS) of the 6-hour-old Drosophila \nmelanogaster 1st instar larva used in this study has been previously reported (23, 28). \nBriefly, the genotype of this female larva was Canton S G1 [iso] \u00d7 w1118 [iso] 5905. The \nresulting EM volume contains 4841 z-slices with an x,y,z resolution of 3.8 \u00d7 3.8 \u00d7 50 nm. \nThis dataset includes the complete CNS, including all neurons, synapses, and accessory \nstructures. Note that only the axons and dendrites of sensory neurons and motor neurons, \nrespectively, are present in the volume. However, the morphology and location of these \nneurons was sufficient to match them to the respective neurons in whole animal datasets \nand thereby identify the identities and modalities of sensory axons (33\u201335, 104) or the \ncorresponding muscle targets of motor neurons (71).\nWe identified the boundaries of the brain hemispheres and all brain neurons using \nstereotyped landmarks (105). Neurons and synapses were manually reconstructed by \nmultiple users using the Collaborative Annotation Tool for Massive Amounts of Imaging \nData, CATMAID (28). Many previous publications have contributed to the reconstruction \nof neurons in this CNS (13, 22, 23, 33\u201335, 71, 73, 104), so the completeness of brain \nneurons was first assessed using proofreading status and publication status. A complete \ncensus of the brain was conducted by examining each lineage entry point (105) to identify \nall brain cell bodies. Each cell body was then used as a seed point for iterative reconstruction \nby multiple users until all arbor end-points were identified. The reconstruction process \ngenerally followed previous descriptions (23, 28), however a targeted proofreading process \nwas used by comparing left-right homologous neuron pairs. Quantification of the results of \nthis methodology suggests it produced neuron reconstructions that are robust across multiple \nmetrics (fig. S1, E and F), although some errors of omission were observed.\nAxon and Dendrite Identification\nWe identified all axons and dendrites using a previously developed algorithm, synapse \nflow centrality (SFC) (28). In Drosophila, axons contain most presynaptic sites, whereas \ndendrites contain most postsynaptic sites, except for mushroom body Kenyon cells. SFC \nfinds the shortest physical paths along the neuronal arbor between each pair of presynaptic \nand postsynaptic sites in the neuron. The section of arbor that contains the highest number \nof these presynaptic-to-postsynaptic paths corresponds to a synapse-devoid region located \nbetween the axon and dendrite that we name the linker domain and which generally \ncorresponds to the axon initial segment. We used SFC to identify these linker domains in \nall brain neurons and assigned the axon-dendrite split point to the most proximal part of the \nlinker domain. All split points were generated automatically and then manually proofread. \nWinding et al.\nPage 20\nScience.

Given that many are not reproducible between the left and right hemispheres, \nwe cannot discern whether the observed sto-chasticity is due to errors in reconstruction \nor developmental noise in establishing new synapses or retracting them (28). We therefore \nfocus much of our analysis on the strong reproducible (symmetrical) connections.\nStrong reproducible (symmetrical) connections are defined as those that are observed \nbetween homologous pre- and postsynaptic partners in both brain hemispheres (e.g., if \na connection is observed between left-side pre- and postsynaptic neurons, a connection \nmust also be observed between the matching right-side pre- and postsynaptic neurons). \nAdditionally, these connections must account for on average \u22651% input onto the dendrite in \naxo-dendritic connections. Note that a connection in one brain hemisphere can be <1%, as \nlong as the connection on the opposite side is strong enough to compensate and both are \nobserved. For example, a 0.5% connection and a 2% connection result in a mean connection \nstrength of 1.25%, which passes the 1% threshold. Any analysis indicating use of a \u22651% \ninput threshold uses this left-right thresholding approach.\nHowever, it should be noted that weak connections could have notable functional roles, \nsuch as helping maintain a certain desirable membrane potential (49) or adding noise \nfor computation (50). They could also contribute to idiosyncratic differences in behavior \nbetween individuals.\nClustering\nWe developed a modified spectral clustering procedure to cluster brain neurons based on \nconnectivity. To achieve clustering in which homologous left and right neuron pairs are \nlikely to be in the same cluster (as opposed to having clusters comprised of left-only or \nright-only neurons), we developed a technique to perform a spectral embedding which \ncollapses left and right symmetry into a single embedding space. First, the network was \nsplit into four subgraphs: connections from neurons on the left side to neurons on the left \nside (LL), from right to right (RR), from left to right (LR), and from right to left (RL). \nEach subgraph had its edge weights transformed using a procedure called pass-to-ranks, a \nregularization scheme which replaces each edge weight with its normalized rank among \nall edges and is helpful for spectral embedding in the context of outliers or skewed \nedge weight distributions (106\u2013108). We then embed each subgraph into a d-dimensional \nEuclidean space (d = 24) using the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) as implemented \nin Graspologic (107, 108). Because of an orthogonal nonidentifiability associated with the \nlatent position estimates from ASE (107), we used a joint optimal transport/orthogonal \nProcrustes procedure (109) to align the latent positions of the LL and RR subgraphs, and \nseparately the LR and RL subgraphs. This procedure yields a representation for each node in \nterms of its ipsilateral (LL or RR) inputs and outputs, as well as its contralateral (LR or RL) \ninputs and outputs.

Finally, to ensure that homologous neuron pairs are clustered the same way, we \naverage the embeddings for a left and right node (note that most of these points were already \nclose in this embedded space due to the procedure described above).\nWith this representation for each neuron, we clustered using a hierarchical approach \nto Gaussian mixture models (GMM) inspired by past work on hierarchical stochastic \nblock models (110, 111). GMM on an ASE embedding was recently shown to be a \nconsistent way of estimating the membership assignments for a statistical network model \ncalled the stochastic block model, motivating this approach (107, 112). We use a Python \nimplementation of GMM with model selection (113, 114). In the hierarchical paradigm, all \nneurons currently under consideration are clustered using a 1-component and 2-component \nGMM. The fit of both models is evaluated using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) \nmetric (115), which is commonly used to select the number of clusters in a GMM (116). If \nthe 2-component model is preferred by the BIC score and the number of neurons is not too \nsmall (32 neurons is chosen as the cutoff), then the set of neurons under consideration is \nsplit according to this clustering. This procedure recursed until the depth of the \u201ccluster tree\u201d \nreached eight, yielding a multiresolution clustering of brain connectivity.\nFinding homologous neuron pairs through graph matching\nWe employed a family of techniques based on the Fast Approximate Quadratic (FAQ) graph \nmatching algorithm (30, 31) to predict bilateral neuron pairs on the basis of connectivity. \nThese algorithms seek to find a 1-to-1 alignment of one network's adjacency matrix with \nrespect to another which minimizes the norm of their difference. In this case, the two \nadjacency matrices were the induced subgraphs (all connections among a specified subset \nof nodes) of the left and right hemispheres (i.e., the ipsilateral connections) of the brain. \nWe used 406 groundtruth neuron pairs from previous publications (13, 21, 33) as seeds, \nspecifying a fixed, partial alignment between the two networks. The seeded graph matching \nalgorithm was randomly initialized 50 times (while preserving the known matching from the \nground truth pairs). Predicted pairs from each initialization of the algorithm were recorded. \nWe then ranked potential pairs according to how often they were matched to each other, \nmanually reviewing each potential pair for correctness. This process was iterated multiple \ntimes, with newly identified pairs added to the population of seed pairs, until all reasonable \npairings were exhausted.\nQuantifying similarity of connectivity for neuron pairs\nTo quantify the similarity in connectivity of neuron pairs (fig. S1E), we evaluated how likely \nour pairs were to be matched by an automated, unsupervised algorithm which aimed to find \nthe best alignment of the nodes of the left and right hemisphere networks. We performed \nmultiple graph matchings of the paired left and right hemisphere networks, and measured \nhow strongly each neuron on the left hemisphere was matched to each possible neuron \non the right hemisphere. To do so, we ran the previously developed FAQ graph-matching \nalgorithm (31), using K = 20 initializations and a maximum of 30 iterations for each \ninitialization (see original publication for algorithm details).

We \nranked the elements of each row i of D (settling ties using the average) and then found the \nrank of that neuron's assigned pair. For instance, if a left neuron's true pair on the right \nhemisphere was the neuron it was matched to most strongly, then its neighbor rank was 1; \nif it was matched to its true pair less strongly than only one other right hemisphere neuron, \nthen its neighbor rank was 2, and so on. This provided a metric to evaluate our assigned \nneuron pairs, where high ranks for a neuron's pair in the other hemisphere indicated that the \nassignment agreed with an unsupervised matching of the two networks.\nNetwork ordering from inputs to outputs\nTo order the network from sensory neurons to output neurons (fig. S6, F and G), we \napplied the \u201csignal flow\u201d algorithm (117, 118). Intuitively, this algorithm seeks to find \na one-dimensional number (the \u201cscore\u201d) associated with each neuron, where high values \nindicate a neuron is close to the \u201ctop\u201d (inputs) of the network, and low values indicate a \nneuron is close to the \u201cbottom\u201d (outputs) of the network. To establish this ordering, this \nalgorithm finds the scores which minimize the sum of edge weights which connect neurons \nwith very different scores or which connect a low score neuron to a high score neuron \n(feedback). Unless otherwise stated, we used the network made up of all edge types when \ncomputing the signal flow score for each neuron. When sorting neuron groups, we sorted \nbased on the mean signal flow score within each group. In some analyses (Fig. 2G and \nfig. S7) we computed signal flow for each edge type network independently. For pairwise \ncomparisons of these network orderings, we computed the rank correlation (Spearman's \u03c1) \nbetween the signal flow rankings for each network.\nAnalyzing edges with multiple connection types Edge reciprocity\nReciprocity is a commonly used metric in network science which quantifies the probability \nthat two nodes in a directed network are connected through mutual edges in each direction \nWinding et al.\nPage 23\nScience.

Specifically, it is defined as the number of reciprocal edges divided by the total \nnumber of edges, where a reciprocal edge means that both Aij and Aji are present in \nthe adjacency matrix A. Here, we generalize this notion to multigraphs. With Asource \nrepresenting the unweighted, loopless adjacency matrix for the source network, and Atarget \ndefined likewise for the target network, we define the edge reciprocity r (Asource, Atarget) as r \nas r(Asource , Atarget ) =\n1\n\u2211i, j\nn Asource \u2211\ni, j\nn\nAij\nsourceAji\ntarget\nIn other words, averaged over the entire network, this is the conditional probability \nof observing a reciprocal edge (Aij\ntarget)  conditioned on observing the forward edge \n(Aij\nsource)P(Aji\ntarget = 1 \u2223Aij\nsource = 1).\nProbabilities of overlapping connection types\nTo examine the likelihood of edges with various multiple connection type combinations, we \ncounted the number of (i, j) pairs with each possible combination of edge type occurrences \nin the measured networks (e.g., an axo-dendritic edge with no other type present, axo-\ndendritic and axo-axonic but no other edge types) (fig. S6D). To calibrate expectations for \nthese counts, we used a simple null model of multiplex edge overlaps. This model assumed \nthat each of the four edge type graphs was generated independently, and modeled each \nnetwork as a random (Erdos-Renyi) network. To compute the parameters of this model, we \nfirst simply calculate the global connection probability pk for each network A(k) as\npk = 1\nn2 \u2211\ni, j\nn\nAij\n(k)\nWhere n is the number of nodes, and A(k) is the unweighted, directed adjacency matrix for \nnetwork type k (k = 1,2,3,4 corresponding with AD, AA, DA, DD, respectively). Under the \nassumptions above, the expected number of (i, j) pairs which have only axo-dendritic (AD) \nedges (denote this m([1, 0, 0, 0])) is m([1, 0, 0, 0]) = n2 p1 (1 \u2212 p2)(1 \u2212 p3)(1 \u2212 p4)\nMore generally, we denote x to be a 4-dimensional binary vector, which indicates the \npresence (1) or absence (0) of the AD, AA, DA, DD edge types, respectively. Then, we can \nwrite the expected number of edges under edge type pattern x as:\nm(x) = n2 \u220f\ni = 1\n4\npi\nxi(1 \u2212pi)1 \u2212xi\nUnder this definition, we calculated the expected number of edges for each combination of \nthe four edge types and used this to compare with the observed counts.\nStudying potential information propagation through signal cascades\nWe applied a technique for modeling information propagation through a network based \non the independent cascade model, which has been used to study epidemic and social \ninformation transmission (120).

Synapse counts can be used to \naccurately predict synaptic surface area and are therefore a good proxy for synaptic strength \n(61). Note that when investigating downstream partners of neuromodulatory neurons, such \nas dopaminergic neurons, we focus on their chemical synapses, which maintain a typical T-\nbar structure at the presynapse (13). At each time step, a new set of neurons becomes active, \nand previously active neurons enter a deactivated state for the remainder of the experiment. \nWe modified the original independent cascade model to include a set of \u201cstop\u201d neurons from \nwhich the cascade does not proceed further. This tool allows one to determine how much \nsignal from a given set of starting neurons could reach other sets of neurons in the brain, and \nafter how many timesteps (hops). Our approach differs from some previous models of signal \npropagation across a connectome in that we only allow activation from neurons which were \nactive at the last timestep, rather than from neurons which were activated at any previous \ntimestep (121, 122), allowing us to assess the temporal ordering of the potential flow of \ninformation through the brain.\nTo elaborate on the details of the model, the algorithm starts with a set of user-defined \nnodes which are initially in an active state at time t = 0, and all other nodes in an inactive \nstate, meaning they are susceptible to activation. We denote the set of active, inactive, and \ndeactivated nodes at timepoint t as St\nA, St\nI, St\nD, and Sf, respectively. Our modified cascades \nalgorithm also includes a set of nodes SE which are \u201cend\u201d nodes from which the cascade \nno longer continues\u2014these nodes can become active, but then do not propagate their signal \nat the next timepoint. To determine which nodes bcome active at the next timepoint t + 1, \neach synapse is assigned an equal probability p of transmission, with p = 0.05. For each \noutgoing synapse (i \u2192 j) from each active node that is not a stop node (i \u2208(St\nA \u2212SE)) to \neach previously unactivated node (j \u2208St\nI), we conduct an independent Bernoulli trial with \nprobability p to determine whether that synapse activates node j at the next timepoint. Nodes \nthat had at least one successful activation of an upstream presynapse are included in the set \nSt + 1\nA . Every node that was active at time t is moved to the set St + 1\nD , the deactivated nodes \nwhich cannot be activated again during the current cascade. This process was repeated for \nT timesteps, where T could vary depending on the particular question of interest. These \ncascades were run 1000 times for the same set of start and end nodes (St = 0\nA , SE). To \nunderstand how signals could propagate through the brain based on this model, we tracked \nthe probability that a node was active at a given time over these 1000 independently run \ncascades. Neurons were considered to receive cascade signals when visited in most cascade \niterations. In Fig. 4F, only pathways contributing substantial cascade signal per hop were \nconsidered (>0.1 multihop signal). When analyzing groups of neurons, signal cascade data \nwere aggregated by averaging these activation probabilities across neurons in a group.\nStatistical analysis\nMann Whitney U tests were used in fig. S19, F to I, and fig. S10G.

To make \nNBLAST scores symmetric (same score between neurons (i, j) as between (j, i) we set \nthe NBLAST scores for (i, j) and (j, i) to be the geometric mean of their original scores. \nWe then apply a normalization scheme to each pairwise NBLAST similarity matrix, in \nwhich scores are converted to their pairwise ranks in the similarity matrix (108). With these \nnormalized NBLAST scores, we defined a simple score of morphological similarity within \neach cluster. First, we computed the mean of all pairwise similarity scores between neurons \nin a hemisphere of a specific cluster. Then, we took the mean of those average scores \nbetween left and right hemispheres to compute the final score for a given cluster.\nCode\nAnalyses relied on NumPy (125), SciPy (126), Pandas (127), NetworkX (128), navis (124), \nand pythoncatmaid (https://pypi.org/project/python-catmaid/).

Pre- and postsynaptic sites were considered complete when connected \nto a brain neuron or ascending arbors from neurons outside the brain.
