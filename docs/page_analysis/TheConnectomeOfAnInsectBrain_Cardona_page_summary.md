**Figures with Captions**:
- `page_44_fig_1.png`: Schematic of common recurrent and efference copy a-d pathways observed in the brain with a focus on DNVNC connectivity.

**Neuron Types**: output, of, a1, premotor, preoutput
**Key Concepts**: recurrent
**Text Excerpt**: described in (A, iii). DNsVNC were grouped either by candidate behavior or level 7  clusters (iv). These independent groupings were highly correlated (Cramer's V Correlation  Coefficient = 0.58). (C) Schematic of common recurrent and efference copy a-d pathways  observed in the brain with a focus on...
